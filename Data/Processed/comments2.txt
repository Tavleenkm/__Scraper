I’ve written comments on this sub basically going over it and that his goal is forced errors, which he tends to get.
This may be a dumb question, but what is the difference between a forced and unforced error? As far as I can tell, people consider errors committed while returning serve to be forced, but all other errors are unforced. Is that right? Personally, I hate the term forced error, as it seems like an oxymoron.
Watch Grigor Dmitrov play and it will be clear what is an unenforced error in a rally.
Broadly, UE is the result of a player’s mistake and FE is the result of an opponent’s good play. 
It’s kind of a nonsense stat.
He strikes first
It's from 2016 but still a very relevant article. Enjoyed this comment, particularly the last line:
There were matches in 2011 against Rafa when no matter how hard Rafa hit, no matter where Rafa hit, Novak always hit the ball back deep in court. It was frustrating af.
The returning in the USO 2011 was insane. He was hitting returns within inches of the servers feet
The djokovic special
And does it on returns that look like he’s lucky just to get the racket on the ball.
The 3rd set of that match is one of the best sets they ever played. Djokovic was at a crazy level and Nadal just decided, no matter the level, he is going to fight.
Depth, focus, tactic, strategy, return, no technical weaknesses, speed, flexibility, clutchness.
no technical weaknesses
Has it always been bad? I can’t remember for some reason. It’s pretty insane that he can’t simply hit an overhead. Also I recently learned there’s multiple kind of complex ways to hit overheads or similar shots in padel making tennis look simple
The difference between making 85% or 99% of smashes is maybe 1 or 2 points per match, so really not much
If you miss on a very crucial point it’s a pretty big deal though
Aside from the Olympics, I can’t recall any important matches that his smash has directly lost him a match. Him and Ruud trading djokosmashes on break points in RG final is quite funny tho
2013 French Open semi final vs Rafa to go up a break in the 5th was another big one
Novak does need to get a handle on the overhead (or does he? Clearly doing fine with that “liability”), but overheads are a deceptively hard shot. You don’t always get one that lets you “do your service motion”, and at the same time Novak’s service motion isn’t what you’d use for an overhead. 
It should be simple enough yet at times he seems to completely lose confidence in it
I have seen a pattern though: on balls he tries to take that are too above or slightly behind him it’s practically 90% failure. 
I think it’s more mental than technical at this point. There is a different level of anxiety that goes into hitting a smash vs other shots imo. It’s like you’re waiting for what seems like an hour. To be clear I think he’s the most mentally tough player ever but everyone has a weak point
It's a technical weakness that is exposed by pressure. The coach who fixed Sabalenka's serve published a long article where he talks about how there's really no such thing as "choking", it's actually a technical fault in the player's stroke that is exposed. This is what happens with the Djokosmash.
That’s interesting. Sometimes I wonder if “mental fortitude” is sometimes overly emphasized where there is simply a technical inefficiency being exploited
Same like Lebron and free throws. To think that one if not the best basketball player ever can be not that good on free throws is a lil bit funny haha
It’s funny because I’ve always had a certain anxiety with overheads in tennis, but when I switched to padel, where you are constantly hitting overheads, this feeling is gone. 
It’s depth. Whether that be with his return, with his own serve or just in a neutral rally. He gives the opponents no easy openings. All of his other qualities are excellent of course (he’s the goat for a reason) but his constant depth is probably the most important reason for him having 23 slams.
I’ve seen Meddy play live, it blew my mind how little margin he gives himself, some of his backhands had zero spin and they’re still consistently landing within a foot of the baseline.
Yeah Meddy is 100% an outlier in the way he plays. I like his personality a lot, but his tennis is not something I’m a big fan of. I think elegant strokes with lots of margin and top spin (similarly to how Djokovic does it) are the most beautiful way to play tennis. Medvedev’s tennis looks clumsy to the naked eye, even though it clearly is not clumsy cause he was #1 in the world and has a major win under his belt. Also because of his ridiculous depth, obviously.
And it's also quite fascinating how his style makes Djokovic uncharacteristically uncomfortable. Novak may have won their most recent encounters but not really by that much actually.
I’m not sure why other players can’t also hit a lot of depth, kind of weird concept
Cause they will miss
Why cant other players hit the 3 as good as Curry?
Not sure why people struggle to be the best in the world at something, kind of a weird concept
[deleted]
But like aren’t all players trying yo hit deep consistently. I would understand if this meant when djokovic hits inches from the baseline but even at the lowest competitive level you get scolded for hitting to like the service line
I remember in his Wimbledon SF vs Nadal in 2018, every single return he hit off Nadal's serve was literally inches from the baseline.  Amazing to watch
this match is slept onby many, probably top 5 matches of all time in terms of quality
This is how I felt after watching the 2015 Wimbledon final
This is how I felt after watching the 2014 Wimbledon final
This is how I felt after watching the 2013 Wimbledon final
This is how I felt after watching the 2019 Wimbledon final
Game, set and match, Murray, 6–4 7–5 6–4
Well wimby is the worst slam for nadal so it doesn’t help too much
Sure? But we're just talking about serve/return here
He makes very few mistakes, makes you work for every point and when it matters most, he doesn’t crumble under the pressure - the most clutch athlete I’ve ever seen.
Its like playing a human squash wall. He'll make you make a mistake while returning everything
His mind is something we haven’t seen in sport of any kind
[deleted]
As what I've seen on a YT video comment: "His mental strength must be studied in Oxford University."
Well Djokovic has a lot going for him.
[deleted]
These days sure but over his entire career its not really that special (especially given his height).
I bought Djokovic’s book on nutrition.  It’s amazing what he eats daily on and off season. His diet consists of a lot of fresh fruits smoothies and fibre rich foods that move through the digestive system much quicker. This enables him to stay super energetic even in later rounds. Other people may eat protein rich foods for muscle growth. Although this is good, it can mean the digestive system will remain busy, using more energy throughout the day.. Notice how his opponents match his energy in the first set, but by third set he is still going full blast, but opponents are tiring at this point. This also explains why he is so good on the baseline throughout the whole match
Ahh.. That's why he needs the bathroom break so often.. Lol
Quite possible. Ironically it’s the Australia open that has put harsh rules on bathroom breaks
Wow if only other tennis players ate some more fiber they could match Novak's fitness. I guess is career is over now that the secret is out.
Lol, I mean, he does have a very unique diet and he's IS a really unique player, so...
It’s no secret. It’s just discipline. Most will follow strict diets but will give up at some point and eat what they want. But Novak is very consistent and doesn’t stop even during off season. He also probably maintains a strict fitness regime to accompany his diet too.
If only they could though. Takes a lot of will and discipline to follow such a strict diet to maximize your potential. Hate on it all you want but science works.
What science are you referring to?
That his specific diet (I think it’s gluten free, mostly plant based except some fish?) has a variety of benefits pertaining to muscle fatigue/recovery, decrease in inflammation, reduction in body fat etc. I’m not saying his diet is superior for every athlete but he found the best method that works for him to improve his performance in regards to endurance, flexibility, decreasing risk for injury, etc.
I think McEnroe put it best at the AO '23 when he said, "Novak goes into these zones where, even to the viewers, it just seems like he is never going to miss."
He wins the overwhelming majority of the sets he plays
I thought it was the ✨contact point ✨
That one's for old timers like me
i remember lendl was on a podcast talking about this topic, and he said something like the following (slightly paraphrased):
Skill, fitness and above all, mental fortitude
Yes, he almost never hit a ball that lands into the service boxes. He's called the Serbian metronome for a reason.
I think he always has a good counter punch forehand that is cross court and very angled. His backhand is also good and can be a weapon at times. Along with his general ability to get just about any ball, he builds a lot resilience and forces players to keep having to hit harder and harder shots
Pretty much and this is also why I think he isn’t as loved as fed and Rafa because his game is based on grinding you into submission through errors and overhitting. It’s often a more boring style to watch. The best example is 2019 Wimbledon where fed beat djoker in nearly every single measurable stat, with well over twice the amount of winners, yet still lost.

Lol. Looks like someone didn't watch the beating Federer got in the AO 2016 semi final.
You mean the match where even though fed played terrible he still had 37 winners to djokers 34? Ya l, that’s totally blowing him off the court
'Basically never getting injured'
Coasting on a weak ass era is what makes him so good
lol keep coping
whatever helps you sleep at night buddy, i am not here to judge
That's someone else
He suffered against Federer until 2020, his hardest opponent imo. He suffered against nadal since last year, only now they stopped "occupying his head" as he likes to say
From 2015 to 2020 they played 14 times. Roger won 4 matches, 3 of these were in 2015.
Easier era? Rafa was in an easier era the past 3 years as well (he literally had a cakewalk 2 grand slams (1 us open and 1 Australia open with no Roger due to retirement and no djokovic due to Covid, not to mention Wimbledon 2020 was cancelled, if Covid never created the weak era that perfectly suited nadal (his French open tourneys were never jeopardized) the grand slam count would be at worst 25 djokovic 21 nadal, and maybe even 26 djokovic 21 nadal
You cannot possibly be that f%#%€ dumb. Low effort trolling .
if you can read my edit and give me reason why you say that, I really don't understand
That’s some edit,more like a complete  re-write. With that being said, lost in translation between different cultures is a thing and I will give you benefit of the doubt. The way you wrote it originally , you clearly said that Novak struggled against Federer and Nadal until 2020 which is the furthest thing from the truth .
it was misunderstanding, no problem than
Motherfucker thought using Federer as a counter was a good idea. Fed literally grew up playing scrubs till Nadal and Djokovic came around.
Bro they literally haven’t beaten him in a slam in a decade other than nadal in Roland garros
I wouldn’t say this era is easy at all. I believe this is why fed and Nadal are hanging their boots. They can see the raw young talent already making its way. 
There is a video on YouTube addressing Novak’s “ weak era “ and the guy completely blows that narrative out of the water with facts. Anyone who follows tennis would have to agree with the argument he makes that Roger actually accrued his numbers against weaker competition.

Piss off then
same to you, don't miss the spot
Hey delete this post too. Wouldn't wanna catch those downvotes
Damn it's a hard time to be a Nole hater. And it will only get worse.
Keep crying, it only strengthens the Djoko
He's not that good. If you switch the amount of injuries between Nadal and Djokovic, and if you make 2 slams on clay and 1 slam on hardcourt, Nadal would lead Djokovic something like 40 to 5 in the slam count based on real talent.  Djokovic is just lucky to not get injured and to have 2 slams on his favorite surface.
Ah yes, Nadal who is miraculously never injured on clay, but has consistently retired a round or two before he was scheduled to face Federer/Novak on hard courts and grass
You're some fucking saddo Whitney, you know that?
Clown is the proper word here
Maybe a simple question but why wasn’t (healthy) Andy Murray as successful with deploying this style? If anything he’s probably even stronger than Djokovic so that should’ve helped.
