"I’ve been a patron of Disney World for over 30 years. We are just finishing up three days in the parks and the magic might be gone for me. The experience is in decline and the costs have skyrocketed astronomically. Overall the staff are grumpy, the smiles are forced, and there isn’t any attempt to make guests feel special. They allow too many people in the parks creating longer wait times for everything and the Genie+ system is embarrassing and way over priced. It feels like Disney’s goal is no longer creating a magical experience but more about extracting as much money from each guest as possible. The food in the park is also in decline. Not a single meal was good. We ate at Chefs de France and the $400 meal was sadly pre cooked hours in advance and kept in warming trays. Sorry for the rant, I’m just disappointed at the current state of a once special place.",Negative
“Gene+”,Neutral.
"Gene is going through a divorce and doesn’t need you yelling at him about Rise being down, he can’t help that no matter what his soon to be ex might tell you.",The sentiment of this sentence is supportive and understanding.
Gene only answers to one guy: Gene,Neutral.
True. For Gene. but how about Gene+?,The sentiment of this statement is ambiguous. It may be interpreted as either supportive or uncertain.
isn't that just an overweight version of Gene?,Negative.
No that’s the actualized version of Gene since Laura left him.,The sentiment of this statement is neutral.
"No, Gene+ is Gene after 6 months doing crossfit.",Neutral.
But does he talk about it nonstop 24/7 even after everyone has asked him to stop and told him they don't care?,Negative.
At my church they out a plus after the name to show they are an ordained priest. So gene+ is know as Father Gene or Rev Gene.,Positive
Gene+ is Gene Simmons bitching about why it’s not his face on the app.,Frustrated.
<gene Parmesan gif>,The sentiment expressed is one of amusement.
<Lucille screaming gif>,The sentiment of this is hard to determine without any accompanying text.
Ahhhh! Gene!,Excited/Joyful
Gene Takovic,Neutral
All you have to do is type in “con man Albuquerque.”,The sentiment of this statement is neutral.
I don’t know why everyone gets so defensive about bad park experiences.,Frustrated/dismayed.
"I think people also read ""the experience is getting worse"" as ""the experience is bad"" which are two entirely different statements. I've noticed some things I do feel like are not as good as they used to be, but that doesn't mean I think Disney isn't fun anymore. I think these discussions are worthwhile and should be had. Iger at least recognizes some of the issue which is a good start, but my hope for them treating CMs better is unfortunately low. I hope it gets better though.",Neutral.
"Unfortunately, I think it’s systemic. Better pay, yes, but work morale is universally bad in the service industry. It’s the zeitgeist of it, a culture of dissatisfaction (for good reason in many cases) that just disengages workers.",Negative
"I’ve been in the restaurant industry for 20 years now, 10 in ownership, and you’ve hit the nail on the head here. And as service industry people, we’re keen to seeing it.",The sentiment of this statement is one of agreement and appreciation.
"I love DW for the simplicity and safety. I have 4 kids, most are out of the house now, but I’ve never had an easier and better family vacation than Disney.",Positive
"I’ll speak broadly since I’m not super defensive of Disney, but he basically said everything is worse. You mentioned a specific rational problem that can affect several experiences and feel like everything is worse. That doesn’t feel over the top. But I personally feel his came off “back in my day things were better.” Also - I was there last summer and I could definitely point at some things that should be improved, but I didn’t come away with anywhere near his level of irritation. So I anecdotally disagree with him.",Mostly neutral.
I agree with you.,Positive
And it's only gonna keep getting worse if they keep refusing to pay CMs a decent wage,Negative
"THIS RIGHT HERE!   So many people keep saying 'Then the CMs can find another job"", but they are going to take the magic they create with them, and you are going to get people who are not passionate about their jobs in replacement.",Positive.
"I agree with you, but it’s not an issue of losing good Cast Members. It’s an issue of the company culture shift at Disney. A good company culture can teach anyone how to be a “Disney CM” but a bad company culture, like the one that’s been developing for the past 9 or so years, equates to what we see today. And it’s only heightened by the recent pandemic. There is a lot more rude CMs these days than there’s ever been in the past.",The sentiment expressed in this statement is one of dissatisfaction and disenchantment with the changing company culture at Disney.
[deleted],The sentiment cannot be determined.
"Agreed. Lot of bored looking and inconsiderate CMs these days. Was here a few years ago, and it was much better all around.",Negative
"Oh you mean the CM attitude. That's a hard thing to change I imagine, since your job description is basically, ""Be nice to everyone, or else!"" (paraphrasing)",This sentiment appears to be one of resignation or defeat; the speaker seems resigned to the idea that the CM attitude is difficult to change.
"It's not THAT hard to change. It just costs a little bit of that thing that we all spend a whole lot of every time we visit. Money. Keep your employees happy, meaning well paid, benefits (not just health either), and support them. You'll be surprised what happens when people are happy with where they work.",The sentiment of this statement is positive.
"While I'm not denying that the WDW experience has declined in recent years...you just visited during one of the busiest weeks of the year - the middle of Spring Break, which has historically  ALWAYS been packed.",Neutral
You couldn’t pay me to go to WDW during peak times,Negative
"If anyone wants to pay me to go, ill go",Indifferent.
I’ll give you a dollar to go.,Neutral
It's Spring break in Orange County right now for elementary school kids.,Positive
We have always travelled during March break and Christmas because my wife is a teacher. All of my past experiences are during peak times.,Positive
The Orlando airport just had its busiest day ever.,Positive
MCO experience deteriorating.,Negative
Testify! That airport is terrible.,Negative
Being a local I actually do not mind it. Lol. Precheck is the way.,The sentiment of this statement is positive.
People are making up for missed vacations. It's been wild.,Positive
"At first, but is that still the case?   I think all the people moving to Florida are buying annual passes and the locals are making it unbearable for the people who save for their once every 5-10 year trips.",The sentiment of this statement is skeptical.
"Yes. Still. Think about it. It is always busy around this time a year, so you have that plus people who put off their disney trips for a couple of years. People are rescheduling them sporadically, and I think we will continue to see that for at least the rest of the year. But you're right, I'm sure the flood of people moving to Florida has contributed as well. I don't think it is any one thing. A lot of different things are coming together for the perfect storm. Regardless. It's crazy.",The sentiment of this statement is that it is a chaotic situation with a lot of different factors combining to create a perfect storm.
"I’m with you here. I find the “but you went at a busy time” comments very unhelpful. Disney is always busy compared to almost anything else, even during their “off peak” seasons. It’s not unreasonable to expect good food, good service, and an enjoyable holiday during a peak season. You are paying for that privilege! You are correct to expect better.",The sentiment expressed is one of agreement and understanding in the form of supportive sympathy.
Yeah I have to say that’s honestly rotten luck and I’m sorry that happened! We were there the week after Labor Day and everything was so chill and we had a wonderful time.,The sentiment of this statement is sympathetic.
As another teacher...we only get peak times off. Peak times are when school is out.,Neutral
"I realize that. My stepmom has been a teacher for nearly 20 years now. OP said they always do spring break and Christmas, there are other breaks times they could go even that aren’t quite as crazy as those two.",The sentiment of this statement is one of understanding and appreciation.
We went in October and it was wonderful. We did pay for all the extras and that was a little eye opening with costs but the only rides we had to wait longer than 30 minutes for were ones that had maintenance issues and broken down.,Positive
When in October did you go? We are headed there during the 3rd full week of October because it coincides w/ my husband's work conference.  I'm really hoping that 1-1.5 weeks before Halloween it will also be fairly chill? * pretty please *,The sentiment is hopeful.
First week the 3rd thru the 9th I think?  It was also no weekend.,Neutral
