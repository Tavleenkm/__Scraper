Actually insane how Riot manages to keep this game relevant over 10 years after its release.,Positive.
Actually insane how Riot manages to keep this game relevant over 10 years after its release.,Positive
It's a bit wild how popular LoL is in China. I was reading my Chinese feed (almost entirely unrelated to gaming) and people were freaking out about this.,Neutral
Look up the EDG worlds win Chinese celebration in Youtube and it's the biggest thing I've ever seen in esports,Positive.
"I remember when Chinese viewership numbers were posted many years ago and Reddit refused to believe they were legitimate for many years, buying into the stereotype that China fakes numbers. Turns out they weren't fake. Video games are insanely popular there.",The sentiment of this statement is skeptical.
"It is true, the numbers that are shown are arbitrary.  But Riot will always release the official numbers a bit later",Neutral.
"Faker is STILL playing? I stopped following competitive League like 4-5 years ago, and already then there was talk of him retiring...",The sentiment appears to be nostalgic and surprised.
"He just won his 4th championship, 10 years after winning the first one. He's basically cemented his legacy as the undisputed greatest",The sentiment is one of admiration and awe.
Back in my day he had already secured his legacy üòÇ,The sentiment expressed in this statement is nostalgic amusement.
"Split faker's career into two and he just takes the #1 and #2 goat spots, that's how insane it is.",Neutral.
I remember before he was really known and not even a pro player when his Leblanc gameplay videos were being posted and for the time was absolutely unreal gameplay. That was I think more than 11 years ago.,Positive
"Now the meta has changed, nowadays he mostly mind control his teammates into playing like absolute best.",Neutral.
"earlier this year when he had wrist injuries (maybe he was sick, I forget the actual issue), he had to stop playing for a few weeks and his team went 1-7 almost not qualifying for Worlds entirely.",Neutral.
"Jeez, must be demoralizing to realize that youre practically being carried by one person on your team and are pretty much lost without him.",The sentiment of this statement is negative.
"His teammates are arguably better at the game on a mechanical level when it comes to overall gameplay. He just brings a lot of experience, shotcalling, leadership, and can make his teammates shine bright.",The sentiment of this statement is supportive.
he only hopped into a ranked queue cause his norms were taking too long and so he started getting noticed.,Neutral.
The Wayne Gretzky of e-sports,The sentiment of this phrase is admiration and respect.
"That‚Äôs just how GOATs are, Tom Brady, Lebron, Kobe Bryant, MJ, all had two HoF careers",The sentiment of this statement is admiration.
"HoF and goat is really far apart though. Also LeBron has like 3 HoF careers at this point, which is insane.",The sentiment is disbelief and awe.
"That's what he means. Faker was already the best back in the day, but while in other sports/esports other players might rise and become",The sentiment of this sentence is positive.
"the best, Faker has NEVER faltered and lost that title. He's STILL the best and there's never been a question and at this point, winning another worlds, it's cemented he's the best and until he retires there likely won't be someone better.",The sentiment is positive.
"He looked better than ever this year. When he was out with an injured wrist, his team looked utterly amateurish, in danger of missing the tournament altogether. And then this run to the finals where T1 just plain danced around their opponents. 11-1 against the LPL. JDG the super team managed to win one game. LNG, the number two, got only one objective all series - a single herald that didn‚Äôt even manage to tackle a tower.",The sentiment of this passage is admiration and joy.
Yeah his time away showed Faker is the most valuable player in the world.  It's insane how the rest of them forgot how to play when Faker isn't there,Positive
Because he‚Äôs the absolute shot caller and play maker. You ever see him check his lanes?  It looks like his screen is glitching out.,Positive
"What is this revisionist history? This is the best he's looked in a WHILE. Definitely the üêê but he wasn't the best mid in the LCK let alone the world for his whole career. Plenty of dips in form. Which is fine, he's outlasting everyone else and his peaks were dominant af.",Positive
"he's pretty constant at least top 5 world some years he is top 3, some top 5 but never gets below that, and in this year I think it was pretty clear he was the best",Positive
"I don't even play or watch League and I know that name, all I know is the dude's crazy.",The sentiment expressed here is that the person knows the name and that the person associated with it has an unsavory reputation.
He's been the best for longer than quite a few other pros' entire careers lasted.,Positive
I love the ozymandias reference but the irony of using it in this thread given the meaning of the poem is pretty funny.,The sentiment of this statement is positive.
the ceaseless sands of time come for us all in the end,The sentiment of this statement is that life is fleeting and all of us eventually face death.
He‚Äôs never played me.,The sentiment is neutral.
"Of course not, he‚Äôs not Silver.",The sentiment of this statement is negative.
True. He's at least gold since we know he lost to a gold brand.,Positive.
"Isn't he still in like literally every single Worlds trailer that they make each year? I vaguely recall the last one even having the song break down with the word ""god"" with Faker doing a fucking superhero landing on beat.",Neutral.
I didn't even care about Worlds until I saw the Faker Ruler fight with all the history behind it.,The sentiment is neutral.
Well for a while there was some talk but recently he won the League event for the Asian games which basically gives him an exemption form Military Service because of an Athlete exemption rule. and then he just won the World championships for the 4th time.,Positive
"He's STILL WINNING and honestly he was the best he looked since 2017, best mid this worlds.",Positive
Respect APA?,Positive
No joke he had one of the better showings against Faker of the whole tournament.,Positive
And then he got fucken creamed by Palafox lmao.  The NA boys did pretty good this worlds,"This sentiment could be interpreted as amused, as it appears to be making light of a loss in a contest."
Show some respect to Nisqy.,Positive
"Nah, you can't be overlooking Palafaker",The sentiment in this statement is neutral.
He's insane. Even if you cut his achievements in half he's still the best performing player of all time,Negative
Korean wayne Gretzky,Neutral.
Honestly he gives me hope for esports alone. Most franchises can‚Äôt survive off 2-3 years of success or a player with a 5 year career. Faker is proving that age is far less of a factor in gaming than I think almost anyone thought.,The sentiment expressed in this statement is one of admiration and hope.
"Age never really mattered, it's moreso just moving on with your life and not being able to commit 10-12 hours a day, 6 days a week working.","This sentiment is generally positive, as it is emphasizing the importance of having a balanced life and not committing to too much work."
"I don‚Äôt think there was literally any basis in gaming for players with long careers is the main thing I‚Äôm saying. Some that went from BW to WoL but no one has been literally top of the global charts for a game for 10+ years. It IS both a testament to the game staying relevant, but more to the player IMO",Neutral/balanced.
"Fighting game players have long careers. Guys like Tokido, Daigo, and Fuudo are in their late 30s/early 40s and still strong. Fuudo's 38 and probably the strongest SF6 player in Japan atm.",This statement expresses positive sentiment about the longevity of fighting game players.
"Fighting games are mostly a mental game, at least at the top levels.  They are incredibly skilled players, but reflexes matter less and so aging is less detrimental.",Positive
