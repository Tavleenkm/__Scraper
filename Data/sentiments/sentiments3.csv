GET FLAIR!,Excited
"iâ€™m not crying, youâ€™re crying. I feel like an awesome era of tennis is slowly coming to an end.",The sentiment of this statement is bittersweet.
"Sampras, Agassi, Roddick, Federer now Nadal.  Just a few I loved watching through the decades but man, these last 20 years have been something special",The sentiment of this statement is one of admiration and appreciation.
"The last 20 years with Federer, Nadal and Djokovic was the greatest era ever, and unlikely to ever be repeated. Can't see another 3 played with 20+ Grand Slams ever going up against each other.",The sentiment is admiration.
"I was a fan...but one does not belong in this list. At least when talking about ""era's of tennis slowly coming to an end"".",Neutral.
"""Just a few I loved watching""  Wasn't meant to be a pinnacle of career, it was people I enjoyed seeing play the game.",Positive
"Yeah, I know what you mean. Leyton Hewitt was like that for me. Was definitely my favorite player to watch in the early 2000's. Enjoyed his emotion, excitement, etc. I rooted for Roddick but just personally found him a little dull to watch. Maybe due to all the aces lol. Definitely 100% how I felt about Isner, who I also rooted for but didn't really enjoy watching haha.",The sentiment is positive.
oh man Layton such a great one too!  Loved his attitude and flow of the game.,Positive
"To be fair, if Roddick happened to be a bit younger or older his career would likely have looked much different. Facing off against skills like Federer, Nadal and Murray at the peak of your career is certainly bad timing!",Neutral
"Murray also an example of bad timing. The years he was a monster consistently, you had assume combination of the big 3 doing the same.. then his body fails him as they begin to taper off a little",Neutral
If it wasnâ€™t for injuries Iâ€™m pretty sure weâ€™d be talking about the Big 4. And I always liked Murray more than the rest of them.,The sentiment of this statement is one of regret.
"I did too, although I am Scottish so might be just a tiny bit biased. Those 4 went on a crazy run of occupying every semi final and final spot.",Positive
It's definitely the Big 3+1 at the very least.,Neutral
Watched a doc about Marty Fish and Roddick was in it as well and they asked what happened after his US Open win and how he just never went to the heights everyone expected and he flat out said Federer and Nadal were what happened.  He was pretty blunt that they were just at another level of tennis.  Roddick is a good dude.  Wouldâ€™ve loved to see him be as great as these guys but he still had a fantastic career.,The sentiment of this statement is admiration and respect for Roddick.
Bro put Murray in but not Djokovic lmfao,Mildly amused.
I feel like Thiem also got hit hard by timing.,Neutral
"I often wonder if Agassi didnâ€™t have the drug problems, if he would have done better. Also, thereâ€™s a weird world where he would have done worse (drugs are a crazy motivator.)",The sentiment is reflective and uncertain.
"Tbf they never said they were all equals, just that they enjoyed watching them. And I agree with them, Roddick may have only won once but he was pretty much the only American in that era who could keep up with giants, and he indeed made life difficult for them on more than one occasion. His â€˜09 Wimbledon against Federer was legit one of the most exciting matches Iâ€™ve ever watched. His absolute cannon of a serve was always fun to watch. Iâ€™m glad I was able to see him play in person at the US Open a few times.",The sentiment in this statement is positive.
Ahh see I just replied saying his server is why I didn't enjoy watching him though I rooted for him often.,Neutral.
Sampras' departure had hurt.,Negative
Roddick!? He won only one U.S. Open!!,The sentiment of this statement is disbelief.
Dâ€™you mean Djokovic?,Neutral
"Yes.. we're heading into the era of mediocrity with Djokovic losing his edge as well. Barring Alacaraz, no one is a multiple GS winner material.",Negative
"Barring Alacaraz, no one is a multiple GS winner material.",Negative
"Rune, Sinner, Medvedev, Tsitsipas and Zverev are all multiple GS winner material. It's definitely not going to be an era of mediocrity that's for sure.",Positive
Why would I be crying?,Neutral
A true legend. Will be sad to not see him play anymore.,Positive
He will keep doing exhibitions and charity games?,Neutral
Not the same unfortunately,Negative
"True, but can't we be happy for him either way?",The sentiment of the statement is ambivalent.
"they didn't say they weren't, just sad not to see him play anymore.",Neutral.
Iâ€™m not a big tennis fan so I donâ€™t seek out watching it but him and Federer really made tennis special. I watched many matches and tournaments because of them. I just remember being a teenager and being amazed that Nadal won every French open for a while and Federer won every Wimbledon. I may be exaggerating but their dominance was super cool and must have helped grow the sport.,The sentiment in this statement is positive.
The King of Clay,Positive.
Undisputed. I don't use that term lightly either. It is literally hard to believe how dominant he was at the FO for so long. They have to rename the trophy after him.,Positive
Itâ€™s possibly the least disputable title in all of sports.,Positive
"Calling Wayne Gretzky the GOAT in hockey is pretty unanimous, thatâ€™s the only example I can think of off the top of my head",Positive
Ali.,Neutral
Bro you are high comparing Ali to Gretzky. There are many people from many eras with a claim to goat in boxing. Hockey has one.,Neutral.
Was Ali really that good at hockey?,Neutral
"Undisputed means not disputed, as in no one disagrees. Jordan vs Bron is one of the most debated GOAT talks in sports and a lot of people donâ€™t have Ali as the GOAT.",The sentiment of this statement is neutral.
My bad.,Apologetic.
Lol Jordan is heavily disputed.,Neutral
They'll need to make a clay statue of him at Roland Garros.,Neutral
"It's steel, but otherwise they're ahead of you on this one!",Neutral.
A legend in his own time. I distinctly remember watching his first French Open and the absolute violence of his game. Plus the pirate pants haha.,Positive
Seeing his hairline recedeâ€¦. Along with mine. Iâ€™m old.,The sentiment is resigned acceptance.
"I know it's the perspective of the photo but I totally thought ""Damn, he's huge!"" ðŸ˜†",Amused admiration.
Such a privilege to have witnessed his greatness from beginning to end. I hope and pray he wins number 15 at Roland Garros next year!!,The sentiment is positive.
Every other active pro tennis player gives a sigh of relief.,Relief.
Isnâ€™t this the guy who started cramping up during a post match conference and everyone said he was getting a blowjob under the table?,Inappropriate.
