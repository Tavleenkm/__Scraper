"Completely agree about the call to prayer. I experienced that in Morocco and Turkey and it gave me goose bumps. I got COVID in Sirince, Turkey and had to spend a week doing nothing but convalescing on the terrace of our house. Looking forward to the call to prayer helped save me from losing my mind.",The sentiment of this sentence is positive.
"I've been to Cairo and pyramids a couple of times and I must say if they left you to walk around alone simply because you said a polite no then you are one in a million. The hassle, hounding and audacious attempts to get your money is endemic in that place. It's organised and it's what ruins trips for most foreigners. I had folks literally following me through the bazaars repeatedly saying ""Dollar...dollar..dollar"" nice place with lots of history but the locals are just a nuisance",Negative
I did the exactly same trip. Back in Jan of 2022. It was incredible. Only downside is the obnoxious vendors and they have a more conservative culture. Sucked to be a woman but still an impressive trip,Mixed sentiment - the trip was incredible but there were drawbacks.
"We went to Cairo (stayed around Talaat Harb near the Museum) for about $40 AUD per night including a cooked breakfast.. We didn't stay in some walled off resort.. We had an amazing time, just learn to say 'no' and use Uber to get to Giza, we weren't hassled.. We never felt unsafe.. We walked from Talaat Harb to Khan el-Khalili for lunch and back again at night.. Sure people tried to sell us stuff, but if we weren't interested we just kept walking..",Positive
"Reading some of these comments, it's sad how so many have a negative view of Egypt. I've been twice now and have only ever been treated very good by locals there as a Brit who only speaks English, Cairo is chaotic but in the best ways, its so full of life and things to experience. Yes in most areas there are very poor people and when they see you're a foreigner will try to hustle you but you never feel unsafe and they will stop quickly when you say no and ignore them, they are on survival mode and don't mean you any harm.",The sentiment of this sentence is positive.

"I've booked a trip to Cairo in October. Can you  elaborate on how to get to the 9 pyramids lounge? It seems complicated. Also, We're dividing our time there between an inexpensive B&B in Giza (that pyramids view!) and a more upscale hotel in the Zamalek neighborhood.

"I went last year and both Cairo and Alexandria were full of friendly people. That said, the area was extremely dirty. A lot of garbage on the road and in Alexandria in particular, you couldn't go a block without mounds of dirt/garbage/feces/oil. I love travelling and have been a lot of places. Egypt was very high on my list and I have to say, if you're going to travel there, do a lot of research on the neighbourhoods you stay in, and take your shots before going.",Generally negative
