Comment,Sentiment
"Apologies if this gets asked allot. Absolutley done with watching my regular YT photography channels, I just don't give a shit about new gear anymore, awful clickbait thumbnails & titles are getting worse, and the tribal nature between big brand fanboys in comment sections is boring. I want to remove myself from this part of the photography world to stop that feeling of always needing to upgrade.",The sentiment of this statement is negative.
