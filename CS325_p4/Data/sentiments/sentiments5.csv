"""But the real problem is that even the pictures i take myself, outside work, let’s say i call a friend out or take pics of my girlfriend and want to post them on my page, they won’t let me post without their presets as well (for marketing purposes) and to associate me with them."" -",The sentiment in this quote is frustration.

"if they're putting their name on it, then you deserve to get paid for it. if they arent paying you for it, they dont get to put their name on it....","The sentiment of this statement is that one should be fairly compensated for work and that if a person or business is not willing to pay for work, then they should not be allowed to take credit for it."
"For starters, do you have a contract with them that you signed? What does it say about this?",Neutral.
"I doubt that legal, I don't see how they could own rights over what you might do off the clock.",Neutral

Unless you have some sort of non-compete I don't see how this is a thing.,Neutral.

Send them an invoice for your work off time if they want to use your copyrighted images or better yet get a new employer.,Neutral
"I would really like to see the verbiage in your contract that specifically states this. I find it very difficult to believe it's there, or that it's in any way legal. But seriously, if it's not writing they have no right to anything you do off the clock on your own time. If you did sign something agreeing to such a thing, I would get out of that ASAP.",The sentiment of this statement is skeptical.
What? There's no way they can enforce this. Grow a pair and tell them to fuck themselves,Negative
Take some dick pics and post them in their style with their logo. You’ll get fired but it will be worth it!,Negative

fuck that,Negative

"Unless you signed a non-compete contract and it explicitly says they own any work of yours/you cannot work on other projects, then they cannot enforce it nor can they use any of your images without your consent.

They crossed that out of my contract and signed it.",The sentiment in this statement is confusion and frustration.
"I think it depends on the contract I used to work for a manufacturing company (unrelated I know) but when I got hired they had a section of all the products/project I was potentially developing on my own time, any product not listed the company could claim as mine and I could always go and add something during the rest of my employment.",Neutral.
I think base the decision on whats more important freedom of expression without any limitations or a stable income.,Neutral.

What does your contract say?,Neutral.
