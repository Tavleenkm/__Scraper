Comment,Sentiment
Notice I said most people. Here's some reasons this would not be the best camera for you.,Neutral.
"On point 4, you have to be careful depending on the model. I had a Nikon D50 which would only recognize standard SD cards, not SDHC or SDXC, so a 128 GB card would not work in the camera. I had to buy a slow, low capacity card for it to work.",Neutral
"Mirrorless cameras with an EVF that will do exposure simulation as you adjust the ISO, shutter, and aperture are available in the price ranges you are advocating, so people get an understanding of what does what as they change settings.  Someone who is trying to learn photography benefits from that more than an expert does.",The sentiment of this statement is positive.
I in general agree though some of the body recommendations could be changed slightly.,Neutral.
I'm glad I learned the fundamentals on a Nikon D7000. I started on OG YouTube tutorials like for example Digital Photography 1 on 1 with Mark Wallace. I was watching those even before actually having a DSLR and as I was watching more and more I realize I need a proper camera and get into this.,The sentiment of this statement is positive.
"Kinda surprised to see people hating on these cameras and lenses in the comments lol. I have one and also an x-t5 and I still frequently use my old d3300. It’s lightweight, has good lenses, and zero stress to use cuz it’s not really worth anything. I see people saying the sensor is bad, but I regularly get wonderful looking images out of it.",Positive
"Hard disagree, sorry.",Negative
"Let's say I own an electric bicycle (I do). One day I get interested in motorcycles, and ask a friend what one I should buy to learn to ride. They tell me I should ride my electric bike as a ""starter"" motorcycle until I've mastered the basics. [...] Huh?",Positive
A Late 00s DSLR is the Best Camera for Most Beginners,Positive
Perfect guide and one that I’m gonna use for future questions,Positive.
"They'd probably learn more shooting film, TBH, and at least that way it's not throwaway technology at the end of their learning.",Neutral
you lost me at recommending an 18-55 kit lol,Sarcastic disapproval.
"Good point on the SD card compatibility -- thankfully standard SD cards are still cheap as dirt, but it is something to watch for. I made some edits.",Neutral.
What body recommendations would you change?,Neutral
A used D7000 today costs about $270. Hell of a deal!,Positive
Every sensor in the world is good if you saturate it.,Neutral.
I'd like to know more about used M43 cameras and what's a base budget to get something usable. Do you have any go-to recommendations?,Neutral.
"Second the analog, manual experience. I'd wager even better than an old dslr, which is just worse tech basically.",Positive
"That's weird, man. If your friends want motorcycles just tell them a motorcycle to buy. Saying they need to be ""ready"" to learn is some weird gatekeeping.",This sentiment is critical.
"This comment feels like it was written by someone who has never actually used a DSLR. Canon and Nikon have had great autofocus since the 90s, and focus > compose > expose > shoot is just not that hard to do.",Neutral
I got so tired of typing the same answer to people in /r/cameras that I wrote this up. Hope it helps!,Neutral.
I used to teach photography. People would call me up before the class began saying they got a Nikon D3x00 or Canon Rebel with an 18-55mm and asked me what other lens they should get. I told them to go through the class with the 18-55mm and it would be perfect for learning.,Positive
... because?,Indecisive or uncertain.
That's a very good lens.   You are showing your lack of knowledge by disparaging it.,Neutral.
I agree. If you want to get someone into photography get him Canon 50mm 1.8 or that Nikons 35 1.8 and wow them with natural bokeh. 18-55 will not look much different from modern smartphone at glance.,The sentiment of this statement is positive.
"Will say though that my D3300 with the Nikon 55-300 VR does quite well for wildlife if you use single-point AF. I'm sure mirrorless would be better, but I'm happy so far.",Positive
Does it? That seems a bit steep lol,The sentiment is humorous skepticism.
You clearly didn't actually read what I said.,Negative.
it sucks,Negative.
I mean .. I’ve used it .. garbage,Negative
"Depends on the condition, but the I/O is still pretty great for a lot of pro setups.",Neutral.
I mean .. I’ve used it .. garbage,Negative.
Whatever,Neutral
"It has a lot of features and some “pro” features as well, like dual SD card slot, which even in this day and age is sometimes missing from APSC and even entry level FF bodies.",Neutral
