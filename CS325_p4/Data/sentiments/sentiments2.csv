Comment,Sentiment
"This subreddit discusses all levels of tennis, from tour professionals to recreational players.",Neutral.
https://youtu.be/0t8Yj8Xm7jY,The sentiment of this link is unclear since it is to a video and not to text.
"I’ve written comments on this sub basically going over it and that his goal is forced errors, which he tends to get.",Neutral.
"This may be a dumb question, but what is the difference between a forced and unforced error? As far as I can tell, people consider errors committed while returning serve to be forced, but all other errors are unforced. Is that right? Personally, I hate the term forced error, as it seems like an oxymoron.",The sentiment in this statement is likely confusion.
Watch Grigor Dmitrov play and it will be clear what is an unenforced error in a rally.,Neutral
"Broadly, UE is the result of a player’s mistake and FE is the result of an opponent’s good play.",Neutral
It’s kind of a nonsense stat.,Negative
He strikes first,Negative
"It's from 2016 but still a very relevant article. Enjoyed this comment, particularly the last line:",Positive
"There were matches in 2011 against Rafa when no matter how hard Rafa hit, no matter where Rafa hit, Novak always hit the ball back deep in court. It was frustrating af.",Frustrated and admiring.
The returning in the USO 2011 was insane. He was hitting returns within inches of the servers feet,Positive.
The djokovic special,"The sentiment of ""The djokovic special"" is generally positive."
And does it on returns that look like he’s lucky just to get the racket on the ball.,Neutral.
"The 3rd set of that match is one of the best sets they ever played. Djokovic was at a crazy level and Nadal just decided, no matter the level, he is going to fight.",The sentiment of the sentence is positive and admiring.
"Depth, focus, tactic, strategy, return, no technical weaknesses, speed, flexibility, clutchness.","This sentiment appears to be positive, indicating that the person is likely highlighting the strengths of someone or something."
no technical weaknesses,Neutral.
Has it always been bad? I can’t remember for some reason. It’s pretty insane that he can’t simply hit an overhead. Also I recently learned there’s multiple kind of complex ways to hit overheads or similar shots in padel making tennis look simple,Neutral.
"The difference between making 85% or 99% of smashes is maybe 1 or 2 points per match, so really not much",Neutral
If you miss on a very crucial point it’s a pretty big deal though,Negative
"Aside from the Olympics, I can’t recall any important matches that his smash has directly lost him a match. Him and Ruud trading djokosmashes on break points in RG final is quite funny tho",Positive
2013 French Open semi final vs Rafa to go up a break in the 5th was another big one,The sentiment of this sentence is excitement.
"Novak does need to get a handle on the overhead (or does he? Clearly doing fine with that “liability”), but overheads are a deceptively hard shot. You don’t always get one that lets you “do your service motion”, and at the same time Novak’s service motion isn’t what you’d use for an overhead.",Neutral.
It should be simple enough yet at times he seems to completely lose confidence in it,The sentiment of this statement is uncertainty.
I have seen a pattern though: on balls he tries to take that are too above or slightly behind him it’s practically 90% failure.,Negative.
I think it’s more mental than technical at this point. There is a different level of anxiety that goes into hitting a smash vs other shots imo. It’s like you’re waiting for what seems like an hour. To be clear I think he’s the most mentally tough player ever but everyone has a weak point,The sentiment expressed in this statement is that anxiety can impede performance even when a player is very mentally strong.
"It's a technical weakness that is exposed by pressure. The coach who fixed Sabalenka's serve published a long article where he talks about how there's really no such thing as ""choking"", it's actually a technical fault in the player's stroke that is exposed. This is what happens with the Djokosmash.","This sentiment seems to be positive, as the coach is fixing a technical weakness in Sabalenka's serve and dispelling the notion of 'choking.'"
That’s interesting. Sometimes I wonder if “mental fortitude” is sometimes overly emphasized where there is simply a technical inefficiency being exploited,Neutral.
Same like Lebron and free throws. To think that one if not the best basketball player ever can be not that good on free throws is a lil bit funny haha,The sentiment of this statement is humorous.
"It’s funny because I’ve always had a certain anxiety with overheads in tennis, but when I switched to padel, where you are constantly hitting overheads, this feeling is gone.",Positive
"It’s depth. Whether that be with his return, with his own serve or just in a neutral rally. He gives the opponents no easy openings. All of his other qualities are excellent of course (he’s the goat for a reason) but his constant depth is probably the most important reason for him having 23 slams.",Positive.
"I’ve seen Meddy play live, it blew my mind how little margin he gives himself, some of his backhands had zero spin and they’re still consistently landing within a foot of the baseline.",Positive
"Yeah Meddy is 100% an outlier in the way he plays. I like his personality a lot, but his tennis is not something I’m a big fan of. I think elegant strokes with lots of margin and top spin (similarly to how Djokovic does it) are the most beautiful way to play tennis. Medvedev’s tennis looks clumsy to the naked eye, even though it clearly is not clumsy cause he was #1 in the world and has a major win under his belt. Also because of his ridiculous depth, obviously.",The sentiment of this statement is generally negative towards Medvedev's style of play.
And it's also quite fascinating how his style makes Djokovic uncharacteristically uncomfortable. Novak may have won their most recent encounters but not really by that much actually.,The sentiment of this statement is neutral.
"I’m not sure why other players can’t also hit a lot of depth, kind of weird concept",The sentiment is questioning.
Cause they will miss,Sadness.
Why cant other players hit the 3 as good as Curry?,Neutral.
"Not sure why people struggle to be the best in the world at something, kind of a weird concept",Neutral
[deleted],The sentiment cannot be determined.
But like aren’t all players trying yo hit deep consistently. I would understand if this meant when djokovic hits inches from the baseline but even at the lowest competitive level you get scolded for hitting to like the service line,Neutral
"I remember in his Wimbledon SF vs Nadal in 2018, every single return he hit off Nadal's serve was literally inches from the baseline.  Amazing to watch",The sentiment is admiration.
"this match is slept onby many, probably top 5 matches of all time in terms of quality",Positive
This is how I felt after watching the 2015 Wimbledon final,The sentiment of this statement is likely joy and satisfaction.
This is how I felt after watching the 2014 Wimbledon final,The sentiment is likely one of excitement and fulfillment.
This is how I felt after watching the 2013 Wimbledon final,Neutral.
This is how I felt after watching the 2019 Wimbledon final,The sentiment is likely one of fulfillment and satisfaction.
"Game, set and match, Murray, 6–4 7–5 6–4",Neutral.
Well wimby is the worst slam for nadal so it doesn’t help too much,Negative
Sure? But we're just talking about serve/return here,Neutral.
"He makes very few mistakes, makes you work for every point and when it matters most, he doesn’t crumble under the pressure - the most clutch athlete I’ve ever seen.",Positive
Its like playing a human squash wall. He'll make you make a mistake while returning everything,The sentiment of this statement is frustration.
