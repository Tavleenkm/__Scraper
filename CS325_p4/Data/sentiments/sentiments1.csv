"Hello, i’ve been a photographer for sometime now. I have my own instagram page, my own equipment, and i have already posted a bunch. Recently i got hired at an event agency (photo/video) and i get to shoot most of their events (parties, weddings… you name it)",The sentiment of this statement is positive.
"""But the real problem is that even the pictures i take myself, outside work, let’s say i call a friend out or take pics of my girlfriend and want to post them on my page, they won’t let me post without their presets as well (for marketing purposes) and to associate me with them."" -",This sentiment is frustration.
Copy/Paste the portion of the contract that details these restrictions here.,The sentiment of this statement is neutral.
"For clarity, are you posting the event stuff on your own IG or theirs?",Neutral.
They don’t own everything you do.,Neutral.
Just create an online account under a different name and post away. They’ll never know.,Neutral
"Most of the comments have been about whether or not the company can enforce this, but you also started that ""They pay really good money, so idk what to do.""",Neutral
"What you do outside of work is yours and not theirs. Unless you signed a very, very bad contract. Even then it's likely some of that is not enforceable.",Neutral.
"if they're putting their name on it, then you deserve to get paid for it. if they arent paying you for it, they dont get to put their name on it....",The sentiment expressed in this statement is fairness.
"For starters, do you have a contract with them that you signed? What does it say about this?",Neutral.
"I doubt that legal, I don't see how they could own rights over what you might do off the clock.",Neutral.
"But regardless of legality, it's most definitely abusive.",Neutral
"they don't have any right over your personal account no matter what, as long as you don't post your personal stuff on their business account there is nothing they can do about it",The sentiment is reassuring.
Unless you have some sort of non-compete I don't see how this is a thing.,Neutral.
"You need to say at least what country you're working in to get realistic advice. If you're in the US, do you have an independent contractor, employee with a work contract, or at will employee? Full time/part time?",Neutral.
Send them an invoice for your work off time if they want to use your copyrighted images or better yet get a new employer.,Neutral.
"I would really like to see the verbiage in your contract that specifically states this. I find it very difficult to believe it's there, or that it's in any way legal. But seriously, if it's not writing they have no right to anything you do off the clock on your own time. If you did sign something agreeing to such a thing, I would get out of that ASAP.",The sentiment expressed in this statement is skepticism and concern.
What? There's no way they can enforce this. Grow a pair and tell them to fuck themselves,The sentiment in this statement is hostile.
Take some dick pics and post them in their style with their logo. You’ll get fired but it will be worth it!,Negative
I suspect this is more them trying to prevent moonlighting getting paid by someone else which is lost revenue potentially vs you can post snaps to Facebook that are not on location - but yeah just ask,The sentiment of this statement is neutral.
"Make a fake alternate persona.  ""I didn't take or post the photos, Jackie Daytona did!""",The sentiment of this statement is confusion.
“Won’t let me” and “personal” don’t go together. People have to learn to stand up for themselves.,The sentiment of this statement is that people should be independent and take personal responsibility for their own actions.
The professional photography world is filled with people afraid to say no or take an L.,Neutral
Why did you sign a contract giving them control of your photos taken off the clock?,The sentiment of this statement is skepticism.
fuck that,Negative
"Unless they made you sign a contract that prohibits this, they have no say over what you do with your own equipment on your own time. And assuming there are no such terms in the contract, and they fire you over it, you should have grounds for an unlawful termination suit.",The sentiment of this sentence is supportive.
"Unless you signed a non-compete contract and it explicitly says they own any work of yours/you cannot work on other projects, then they cannot enforce it nor can they use any of your images without your consent. They'd need to pay for licensing to do that.  Especially if it's on your time, your equipment,  your art direction, editing, etc. That photo is legally yours.",Positive
"Yeah, tell them to get fucked. What you do outside of work hrs is none of their business",Negative.
The contract you signed is your guide. Check and recheck everything the contract states.,Neutral.
"I had a contract at a place once that said anything designed or invented during your working hours belongs to the company. And so I was like ""if I work on my own company during lunch, you own it?"" They crossed that out of my contract and signed it.",The sentiment of this statement is wariness and confusion.
"I think it depends on the contract I used to work for a manufacturing company (unrelated I know) but when I got hired they had a section of all the products/project I was potentially developing on my own time, any product not listed the company could claim as mine and I could always go and add something during the rest of my employment.",The sentiment expressed in this statement is one of caution.
I think base the decision on whats more important freedom of expression without any limitations or a stable income.,Neutral
Personally a well paying photography jobs are hard to come by so you don’t want to hurt yourself by chasing own goals that may not reward you financially but will creatively.,The sentiment of this statement is optimistic but realistic.
Are you an employee or work for hire!,Neutral.
What is in your employment contract?,Neutral.
Did you sign a contract with that clause in it? That seems like a gross overreach,Skeptical.
It would be a good idea of you keep your personal IG account seprate for work and keep a different account for the photoshoots that you do with yours friend's and stuff,Positive.
I wouldn’t accept that. It depends on your priorities though,The sentiment is neutral.
Weird job you have,The sentiment of this statement could be interpreted as sarcastic or critical.
"Absolutely not. Unless they're paying a hefty premium to reserve your time and copyright outside of working hours, they have no right whatsoever to dictate what you post on your personal social media page.",Negative.
Separate ig accounts for personal and work. It sounds like a communication issue to me.,Neutral.
Just start a new IG page anonymously,Neutral.
Why do you comply with having your own photos ruled over by your employer? That's not their business. Stand up for yourself!,This sentiment is defiant and speaks out against a perceived injustice.
Just create a new account for your personal stuff!,Positive
So take up shooting something they won't want associated with their brand.,Neutral
Personal work on your personal page is nobody’s business but your own. If they want you to use their filter presets on your photos tell them there is a $250 fee per photo (since it’s marketing purposes).,Indifferent.
"I really hate this, because i can’t be creative anymore.",Negative.
"Create another IG account and don't ever tell them about it. What they're doing is messed up, and if you don't like their style you shouldn't be forced to use it on your own creative works.",The sentiment of this statement is one of disapproval.
"Depends a little on where you are, if you're an at-will employee. I agree their requests are unreasonable, but the ultimately question might be whether or not you're willing to get fired over refusing. Which would be legal in many places, illegal in others. Depends on your location...where are you?",Neutral.
What does your contract say?,Neutral.
