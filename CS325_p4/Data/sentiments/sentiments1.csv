Comment,Sentiment
"The Subreddit for Spider-Man comics, movies, and TV series",Positive
"I like Miles, but they've spent two games building up to green goblin as a villain. You can't have Peter taking a back seat during the green goblin arc.",Neutral
They're probably gonna have Goblin as the reason Peter gets back in the game.,Neutral
So you can have the same game a millionth time.,Neutral
"""What do you mean they sidelining Spider-Man for showing Miles as better one, It's just a conspiracy theory."" Let's see how Miles gonna fight against his arch-enemy Green Goblin. They have 60 year of history in the comics after all.",The sentiment of this statement is skeptical.
"This shit really pisses me off. Spider-Man PS4 gave us one of the best versions there are of the character, and you’re seriously telling me that they’re planning to backseat him? This is bullshit.",Negative
"Shhhhh, the Miles Defense Force will end you!",Unfriendly/Hostile.
No one in this game is 60.,Neutral.
Yeah it worked so well for Gotham Knights,The sentiment of this statement is positive.
I don't really care about that.. there are tons of failed superhero games.,The sentiment of this statement is apathetic.
Okay but some of us like this game series. I liked both 1 and 2 and I'd love to see everything come together in 3. So I would rather the 3rd one didn't do some insane shit like not star Peter Parker.,Positive
"If you ""really like this game series""... Then allow those who made it Their Way.. to continue creating it.. to continue telling the story that you claim to like so much.",The sentiment of this statement is encouraging and supportive.
The addition of Miles isn't ruining anything. Removing Peter Parker is. They can make a new story without removing Peter lol,Positive
Who said he was removed?,The sentiment of this phrase is neutral.
Yeah or we are just allowed to have an opinion that isn't yours,The sentiment of this statement is defiant.
Or SAME.. tell that to everyone downvoting those who Like change..,The sentiment of this statement is frustrated and resigned.
"I suppose Peter should never grow as a human being ever, and fight forever to appease his ""fans"" who care about him so much",Negative
I wonder what this will mean for the Carnage DLC. That was a very personal thing for peter especially with Yuri being involved,The sentiment expressed in this statement is one of curiosity and anticipation.
Yeah it’s gonna be really weird if it’s just Miles and Yuri all of a sudden. Very awkward.,Negative
This sucks. I don't dislike Miles but man I love Peter so much more.,Negative
"This is how they’ll end up getting people to dislike Miles, something they clearly don’t understand.",Negative.
Also stuff like how miles keeps making shittier “one of one” suits for no(in-universe) reason,Negative
Oh so that is why Miles is always so busy in the game - he has to catch up on time lost making all those suits.,Neutral
"This sucks so much, I don't hate Miles, liked him a lot in SM2, but I love Peter so much, do they not realize that by doing this, Miles will automatically get hates for this? but how do you make a 3rd game with Green Goblin; an iconic enemy to Peter, especially with a certain someone returning, with Miles as the main guy instead of Peter.",The sentiment of this statement is one of disappointment and confusion.
Remember when a bunch of people said they were going to do this and they got shouted down as crazy?,Neutral.
Because you guys are not only crazy you aren't the fans of the comics you think you are.,Negative
"You're right... About how comics work. The thing is, this is a video game series and it likely doesn't have many entries left. It won't be running for decades to come like the books, insomniac is going to move on to other projects.",Neutral.
"I gotta admit it takes some chutzpa to be proven wrong and still call the people who were right crazy. Like move the goalposts some more, lol. Though again, I can't take credit here, I didn't think they'd actually do it. I still have my doubts frankly.","This sentiment appears to be one of admiration, a recognition of the courage and audacity of the people who were proven wrong and yet still stand by their position."
"You're right. Most people aren supposing a lot of things for a 3rd game that hasn't even been announced yet. There's space for a DLC, for another side-game... Plus, no one said Peter will never be Spidey again. They probably mean Peter is taking some time off but will be Spiderman again. Either by himself, or because Norman Osborn forces him to. Everyone knows Parker can't stay away from the suit for too long.",The sentiment of this statement is hopeful.
That’s fine but I still want Spider-Man 3 to focus on Peter since it’s all of his villains,Positive.
It shouldn't fouces on Peter at all tho spiderman 2 doesn't fouces on peter.,Neutral.
I don't really care if it's just for some videogame universe but I hope this is not some testing grounds to do the same thing in the 616 one.,Neutral.
It obviously is. Both Disney and Sonny pushing Miles non stop.,Neutral
Imagine wanting to replace one of the most popular characters in all of fiction.,Neutral.
So disney and sony for the past decade.,Neutral
This does suck indeed.,Negative
"I'm out. I'm here for Peter Parker, not Miles. Oh well. I can always just enjoy the first game again.",Neutral.
You should be here for both no wonder people trash the spiderman community,Negative
I don't have to do anything you idiot. We all have our preferred characters. Mine is Peter Parker.,Neutral.
Then stop trying to hate miles because you love Peter he isn't a problem you jackass the game about both so you should be here for both having a preference doesn't mean excluding another character especially since you have no reason to hate that character other then them being a different race,The sentiment of this statement is supportive and inclusive.
"""Other than being a different race""",The sentiment of this statement is neutral.
What about the reason of growing up with Peter Parker as the Spiderman and becoming attached to this character over the years?,The sentiment of this statement is positive.
I get that there still no reason to hate a character because they aren't the character you grew up with.,The sentiment is one of understanding and acceptance.
"First off, go back to school and learn punctuation. Reading your comments is more annoying than playing as MJ.",Negative
People have every right to like Peter but not like Miles. The same is ture vice-versa even if it's a bit rarer.,This sentiment is neutral.
Starting to think now No they don't because the reasons are always stupid they like Peter but miles you hate for what,The sentiment of this statement is negative.
"Let me guess - and I hated playing the MJ segments in the game not because MJ is a lot less interesting character both plot-wise and gameplay mechanics-wise than Spiderman, but because I am sexist, right?",The sentiment of this statement is one of disbelief and frustration.
Well if you think that then yes it's clear you are sexist and one of the few people who don't try to understand a character and actually know who they are.,Neutral
The only thing clear here is that your iq is a double-digit value.,This sentiment is perceived as negative.
Here's a few reasons why people might not like Miles.,Neutral.
