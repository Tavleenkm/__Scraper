GET FLAIR!
iâ€™m not crying, youâ€™re crying. I feel like an awesome era of tennis is slowly coming to an end.
Sampras, Agassi, Roddick, Federer now Nadal.  Just a few I loved watching through the decades but man, these last 20 years have been something special
The last 20 years with Federer, Nadal and Djokovic was the greatest era ever, and unlikely to ever be repeated. Can't see another 3 played with 20+ Grand Slams ever going up against each other.
I was a fan...but one does not belong in this list. At least when talking about "era's of tennis slowly coming to an end".
"Just a few I loved watching"  Wasn't meant to be a pinnacle of career, it was people I enjoyed seeing play the game.
Yeah, I know what you mean. Leyton Hewitt was like that for me. Was definitely my favorite player to watch in the early 2000's. Enjoyed his emotion, excitement, etc. I rooted for Roddick but just personally found him a little dull to watch. Maybe due to all the aces lol. Definitely 100% how I felt about Isner, who I also rooted for but didn't really enjoy watching haha.
oh man Layton such a great one too!  Loved his attitude and flow of the game.
To be fair, if Roddick happened to be a bit younger or older his career would likely have looked much different. Facing off against skills like Federer, Nadal and Murray at the peak of your career is certainly bad timing!
Murray also an example of bad timing. The years he was a monster consistently, you had assume combination of the big 3 doing the same.. then his body fails him as they begin to taper off a little
If it wasnâ€™t for injuries Iâ€™m pretty sure weâ€™d be talking about the Big 4. And I always liked Murray more than the rest of them.
I did too, although I am Scottish so might be just a tiny bit biased. Those 4 went on a crazy run of occupying every semi final and final spot.
It's definitely the Big 3+1 at the very least.
Watched a doc about Marty Fish and Roddick was in it as well and they asked what happened after his US Open win and how he just never went to the heights everyone expected and he flat out said Federer and Nadal were what happened.  He was pretty blunt that they were just at another level of tennis.  Roddick is a good dude.  Wouldâ€™ve loved to see him be as great as these guys but he still had a fantastic career.
Bro put Murray in but not Djokovic lmfao
I feel like Thiem also got hit hard by timing.
I often wonder if Agassi didnâ€™t have the drug problems, if he would have done better. Also, thereâ€™s a weird world where he would have done worse (drugs are a crazy motivator.)
Tbf they never said they were all equals, just that they enjoyed watching them. And I agree with them, Roddick may have only won once but he was pretty much the only American in that era who could keep up with giants, and he indeed made life difficult for them on more than one occasion. His â€˜09 Wimbledon against Federer was legit one of the most exciting matches Iâ€™ve ever watched. His absolute cannon of a serve was always fun to watch. Iâ€™m glad I was able to see him play in person at the US Open a few times.
Ahh see I just replied saying his server is why I didn't enjoy watching him though I rooted for him often.
Sampras' departure had hurt.
Roddick!? He won only one U.S. Open!!
Dâ€™you mean Djokovic?
Yes.. we're heading into the era of mediocrity with Djokovic losing his edge as well. Barring Alacaraz, no one is a multiple GS winner material.
Barring Alacaraz, no one is a multiple GS winner material.
Rune, Sinner, Medvedev, Tsitsipas and Zverev are all multiple GS winner material. It's definitely not going to be an era of mediocrity that's for sure.
Why would I be crying?
A true legend. Will be sad to not see him play anymore.
He will keep doing exhibitions and charity games?
Not the same unfortunately
True, but can't we be happy for him either way?
they didn't say they weren't, just sad not to see him play anymore.
Iâ€™m not a big tennis fan so I donâ€™t seek out watching it but him and Federer really made tennis special. I watched many matches and tournaments because of them. I just remember being a teenager and being amazed that Nadal won every French open for a while and Federer won every Wimbledon. I may be exaggerating but their dominance was super cool and must have helped grow the sport.
The King of Clay
Undisputed. I don't use that term lightly either. It is literally hard to believe how dominant he was at the FO for so long. They have to rename the trophy after him.
Itâ€™s possibly the least disputable title in all of sports.
Calling Wayne Gretzky the GOAT in hockey is pretty unanimous, thatâ€™s the only example I can think of off the top of my head
Ali. 
Bro you are high comparing Ali to Gretzky. There are many people from many eras with a claim to goat in boxing. Hockey has one.
Was Ali really that good at hockey?
Undisputed means not disputed, as in no one disagrees. Jordan vs Bron is one of the most debated GOAT talks in sports and a lot of people donâ€™t have Ali as the GOAT.
My bad.
Lol Jordan is heavily disputed.
They'll need to make a clay statue of him at Roland Garros.
It's steel, but otherwise they're ahead of you on this one!
A legend in his own time. I distinctly remember watching his first French Open and the absolute violence of his game. Plus the pirate pants haha.
Seeing his hairline recedeâ€¦. Along with mine. Iâ€™m old. 
I know it's the perspective of the photo but I totally thought "Damn, he's huge!" ðŸ˜†
Such a privilege to have witnessed his greatness from beginning to end. I hope and pray he wins number 15 at Roland Garros next year!!
Every other active pro tennis player gives a sigh of relief.
Isnâ€™t this the guy who started cramping up during a post match conference and everyone said he was getting a blowjob under the table?
Hopefully he'll grab one more FO title! VAMOS RAFA!
Awww but who will we watch scratch their testicles now??!?!?!
GOAT 
Where's that guy to dare anyone to stop Nadal in 2024?
MY GOAT ðŸ˜¢
ðŸ˜­ VAMOS RAFAAAAA
We are entering the new generation era of tennis (akin to WWF). Federer and Nadal were our Hogan and Macho Man and now we wait for the next characters.
A career cemented in the Hall of Tennis Legends.
Thank f*** for that.

Itâ€™s an abdomen tear that just wonâ€™t heal. Heâ€™s been suffering from it since Wimbledon 2022.
damn, sports hernia. Abs are tricky. Like Chris Sims after losing his spleen during a game. After recovering from surgery, never felt right, ability to throw compromised
One more French open then!
Heâ€™s not done

Djokovic wonâ€™t be winning RG. Itâ€™s not his preferred surface and others form looks better, like Alcaraz.
[deleted]
Agreed, not sure if you read article but he pulled out, he wants to take a break and hopefully return 2024, but the end is in sight for this amazing humans pro tennis career. In respect for Nadal, he has gotten older and a bit slower, but most importantly the injuries and body toll later in the tournament at such an age can really hurt his performance. I canâ€™t believe itâ€™s been so, so many years since I first watched him compete, Iâ€™d be lying if I said it doesnâ€™t make me feel old, but Iâ€™m so blessed to have witnessed his greatness.
I was talking about Djokovic
Oh my mistake, Iâ€™ve never really considered Djokovic to be a high contender for Clay although he has enough trophyâ€™s to prove me otherwise. I just think this year in particular the success of others on Clay leading up to it has been so dominant, notably Alcaraz but even Sinner looks the goods, thereâ€™s so much young talent and the latest meta with the drop shot will prove damaging for Djokovicâ€™s endurance. Something tells me Djokovic wonâ€™t run deep this year, but we will see!
Thing is, itâ€™s a best of 5. There are a few players who have the talent to beat him in a best of three but in a 5 setter Iâ€™ll choose Djokovic every time.
Tell to the folks at home, who is Rafael Nadal?
I don't want to explain anything. If you're going to say that after everything I say I'm going to leave.
You know, I've been dieing to ask, where do you get your ideas?
[removed]
No
It's the end of an Era. What an amazing athlete.  I will forever look up the Nadal.
Likely!? Iâ€™m sure he wonâ€™t win 2023 French Open to make it 15 but heâ€™ll recover and get the one in 2024!
Terrible link, haven't been able to read/open the article because I can't go past the "Privacy" window
Time for the retirement tour. Get your tickets now. Actually itâ€™s probably already too late.
Iâ€™m going to miss him. What are the chances of him playing in the Aus Open 2024?
iâ€™m not crying, youâ€™re crying. I feel like an awesome era of tennis is slowly coming to an end.
