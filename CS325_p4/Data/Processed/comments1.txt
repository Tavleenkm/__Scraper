The Subreddit for Spider-Man comics, movies, and TV series
I like Miles, but they've spent two games building up to green goblin as a villain. You can't have Peter taking a back seat during the green goblin arc.
They're probably gonna have Goblin as the reason Peter gets back in the game.
So you can have the same game a millionth time.
"What do you mean they sidelining Spider-Man for showing Miles as better one, It's just a conspiracy theory." Let's see how Miles gonna fight against his arch-enemy Green Goblin. They have 60 year of history in the comics after all.
This shit really pisses me off. Spider-Man PS4 gave us one of the best versions there are of the character, and you’re seriously telling me that they’re planning to backseat him? This is bullshit.
Shhhhh, the Miles Defense Force will end you!
No one in this game is 60.
Yeah it worked so well for Gotham Knights
I don't really care about that.. there are tons of failed superhero games.
Okay but some of us like this game series. I liked both 1 and 2 and I'd love to see everything come together in 3. So I would rather the 3rd one didn't do some insane shit like not star Peter Parker.
If you "really like this game series"... Then allow those who made it Their Way.. to continue creating it.. to continue telling the story that you claim to like so much. 
The addition of Miles isn't ruining anything. Removing Peter Parker is. They can make a new story without removing Peter lol
Who said he was removed?
Yeah or we are just allowed to have an opinion that isn't yours
Or SAME.. tell that to everyone downvoting those who Like change..
I suppose Peter should never grow as a human being ever, and fight forever to appease his "fans" who care about him so much
I wonder what this will mean for the Carnage DLC. That was a very personal thing for peter especially with Yuri being involved
Yeah it’s gonna be really weird if it’s just Miles and Yuri all of a sudden. Very awkward.
This sucks. I don't dislike Miles but man I love Peter so much more.
This is how they’ll end up getting people to dislike Miles, something they clearly don’t understand.
Also stuff like how miles keeps making shittier “one of one” suits for no(in-universe) reason
Oh so that is why Miles is always so busy in the game - he has to catch up on time lost making all those suits.
This sucks so much, I don't hate Miles, liked him a lot in SM2, but I love Peter so much, do they not realize that by doing this, Miles will automatically get hates for this? but how do you make a 3rd game with Green Goblin; an iconic enemy to Peter, especially with a certain someone returning, with Miles as the main guy instead of Peter.
Remember when a bunch of people said they were going to do this and they got shouted down as crazy?
Because you guys are not only crazy you aren't the fans of the comics you think you are.
You're right... About how comics work. The thing is, this is a video game series and it likely doesn't have many entries left. It won't be running for decades to come like the books, insomniac is going to move on to other projects. 
I gotta admit it takes some chutzpa to be proven wrong and still call the people who were right crazy. Like move the goalposts some more, lol. Though again, I can't take credit here, I didn't think they'd actually do it. I still have my doubts frankly. 
You're right. Most people aren supposing a lot of things for a 3rd game that hasn't even been announced yet. There's space for a DLC, for another side-game... Plus, no one said Peter will never be Spidey again. They probably mean Peter is taking some time off but will be Spiderman again. Either by himself, or because Norman Osborn forces him to. Everyone knows Parker can't stay away from the suit for too long.
That’s fine but I still want Spider-Man 3 to focus on Peter since it’s all of his villains
It shouldn't fouces on Peter at all tho spiderman 2 doesn't fouces on peter.
I don't really care if it's just for some videogame universe but I hope this is not some testing grounds to do the same thing in the 616 one.
It obviously is. Both Disney and Sonny pushing Miles non stop.
Imagine wanting to replace one of the most popular characters in all of fiction.
So disney and sony for the past decade.
This does suck indeed.
I'm out. I'm here for Peter Parker, not Miles. Oh well. I can always just enjoy the first game again.
You should be here for both no wonder people trash the spiderman community
I don't have to do anything you idiot. We all have our preferred characters. Mine is Peter Parker.
Then stop trying to hate miles because you love Peter he isn't a problem you jackass the game about both so you should be here for both having a preference doesn't mean excluding another character especially since you have no reason to hate that character other then them being a different race
"Other than being a different race"
What about the reason of growing up with Peter Parker as the Spiderman and becoming attached to this character over the years?  
I get that there still no reason to hate a character because they aren't the character you grew up with.
First off, go back to school and learn punctuation. Reading your comments is more annoying than playing as MJ.  
People have every right to like Peter but not like Miles. The same is ture vice-versa even if it's a bit rarer.
Starting to think now No they don't because the reasons are always stupid they like Peter but miles you hate for what
Let me guess - and I hated playing the MJ segments in the game not because MJ is a lot less interesting character both plot-wise and gameplay mechanics-wise than Spiderman, but because I am sexist, right?
Well if you think that then yes it's clear you are sexist and one of the few people who don't try to understand a character and actually know who they are.
The only thing clear here is that your iq is a double-digit value.   
Here's a few reasons why people might not like Miles.
After decades of peter being spider-man they can't just replace him like this. It's like dick grayson or terry McGuiness being batman. It's a nice gimmick but in the end Bruce Wayne will always be the BATMAN and peter will always be SPIDER-MAN
I made the same point about Batman in another reply, but now that I think of it I could take Terry as the new MC as long as Bruce Wayne would still be in the game as a mentor (and you know he'd have at least one badass fight scene anyway).   
Well, that certainly confort me in my decision of not buying this game nor it's sequel.
You’re missing out big time
I'm missing out seeing one of my favorite character being written like a chump so to prop a deriative character that I could not care less about ? 
He’s not written like a chump?
Yeah, appart for the dozen time he get knocked out and need Miles to bail him out, including the fucking opening scene, and the closing scene where despite behing the character with the most personnal connection with the bad guy, it still Miles that come and beat Venomized Harry while Peter is laying uncounscious.
Miles didn’t beat Venom, they both did, and Miles said that because he progressed as a character, plus he wouldn’t be accounting for another big event, which is likely to happen in the third game
It shouldn't tho you get to play as Peter still and the next game will most definitely have peter again he just taking a break as spiderman
Ha yes, I could play as my favorite character to see him being saved by Miles a thousands time just to ciment the fact that he his no longuer needed 'cause he now has a deriative replacement.
He isn't being replaced I just told you that also Peter been spiderman for years do you just hate stroy telling your glazing peter so much but you hate when he gets actual character development.
Adorable, you really needed to come back nearly after one week to deliver your spiel.
What are you even talking about nothing you said has anything to do with spiderman 2 are you just making up the worst excuses to hate on the game of are you just trolling.
Illiterate
I am so fucking sick of marvel and imsoniac favoring Miles while Peter is drowning in the ocean. If Miles is gonna be next main character for spider man 3, then I am not buying it. I am tired of this bullshit. I want to play as PETER PARKER. NOT MILES. WHY IS THAT SO HARD FOR THEM TO GRASP.
Gonna be interesting to see the numbers 3 pulls, kinda like comparing 1 with the Miles dlc that they sold as a separate game.
It's not like that because Insomniac won't be that dumb to make a Goblin story and make Peter Parker a supporting character. The Goblin will cause Peter's retirement to end temporarily or permanently.
They do realize they can have both as equals and not sideline one of them, right?
Well said!
Terrible decision.
Holy shit, they didn't have the grace to finish a trilogy with Peter before doing this crap. If they confirm Miles as the main spiderman in the third game, which everything points to being a Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus game, I won't buy it and I'm done with this series. So much potential from the first game wasted.
Isn't this a pretty bad idea from a financial standpoint? Even the most successful Miles content doesn't financially compare to Peter's. And Peter is still a major character in it.
Gotta virtue signal
Inclusion of one shouldn't mean exclusion of another.
Well no shit did y’all not beat the game?
I'm skeptical this will be good for sales but we'll see.
Spider-Man will forever and always be the main Spider-Man, Mike’s is dope but he wasn’t first
Going down the MCU path I see... Shitty sales will sure follow
i don't see the problem with this. Miles is perfectly capable of taking the bulk of spider-manning while peter gets the new EMF set up. the man has to pay his bills, and it's not like he's gonna fully stop being spider-man. he'll still be around, as the postgame of SM2 shows. plus the fact half the people in Miles' community knows he's spider-man makes his life a lot easier than Peter's was at his age.
Exactly. Not to mention, every main villain in the Insomniac Universe has extremely close personal connections to the hero. Norman and Otto are being set up as the main villains. Are they close to Miles or Peter? People complaining about this are incapable of using critical thinking. Peter will not only return, but will have a huge role (if not the LEAD role) in SM3.
In a Spider-Man game Spider-Man being the lead is a "if" that's the problem.
Miles Morales is also Spider-Man. There is no "if". And to be clear, I'm confidently stating that Peter will be the main focus of Spider-Man 3, as he was in Spider-Man 2.
Gonna need more context; what exactly was the original question and end of the quote? Regardless I'm not surprised they would be going with this but Peter should be the main focus of spiderman 3 before letting miles fully take over.
People are misunderstanding, what the writer said was mostly an appreciation post for Miles, also in the full interview he rather says its essential to keep both Spiderman so that: "one can carry the other Spider-Man when he isn't strong enough". It's the article writer who said "Miles is the main Spiderman "
[deleted]
He can live a happy life and have a happy ending while still being Spider-Man dude.
I’m sure this doesn’t mean what we think it means. I swear game designers and writers speak a completely different language, they hardly ever seem to mean what they say. Remember the whole “Venom just wants to kill Spider-Man” thing? I think this means that Pete’s gonna break out the webs when needed, but he’s focused on Peter Parker right now. Which is gonna cause drama when Green Goblin shows up and Miles (and possibly Silk) can’t handle it. I think they’re really gonna play up the whole “this is Peter’s last time being Spider-Man” thing in the third game.
Tons of crying... A mixture of "I'm afraid of change" and pure unspoken PREJUDICE.
No one thinks you're cool.
If anyone thinks that this is actually going to be the case for SM3 and not a vehicle for the drama/build up of Pete being compelled to return and again sacrifice his own needs for the greater good, you need to read more Spider-Man and really just more stories in general.
Just so long as he doesn’t take the Adidas suit into the sequel I don’t care. All they’re going to do is an expansion or a sequel to Spider-Man 2 to help establish Green Goblin so they can go right to it in Spider-Man 3. All it’s going to be is a brief status quo change so the writing team can get their shit together. I don’t see a problem here.
I think everyone here needs to calm down a bit, because by saying 'main Spider-Man' , the writers mean that Miles will be the only Spider-Man. I am sure that the hijinks that start because of the villain(s), will somehow cause Peter's return, who will still be the main protagonist. I have faith in Insomniac's writiing team.
Honestly, this is fair. Miles' personality fits Spiderman really well
imao Smooth Brain Peter's Personality is THE SPIDER-MAN PERSONALITY
I also hope peter comes back for SM3, and im assuming he will, but also all spider-man fans have been asking for is for is for Peter to have a happy life. You gotta make up your mind people
You do realize that he can be happy and Spider-Man right?
Can yall stop being babies.
We are starving for decent Peter content. The idea of this wonderful version of him being sideline is horrible.
Good thing he not being sidelined and you've been starving since you were born Peter had good content for years get over it
We've had to deal with Paul for a while now.
It means Peter gets to have a break and actually have a stable job for once in his life to provide for his family. Also chances are Peter will be out of retirement by the next game considering who the villains are.
Insomniac has done more for Miles than the comics, a lot of people are concerned about Miles being the main Spider-Man while Green Goblin is the main villain for the next installment but I highly doubt Peter will take a backseat entirely. Chances are he’ll come back for Green Goblin. I’m not sure why people are worried about it I thought it would be predictable, since that’s what usually happens when the main character takes the back seat in the story, they usually come back to help.
Good. As a lifelong Spidey fan, I'm happy to see Peter taking a break from the mantle to focus on his personal life. Sort of reminds me of the latter end of the Clone Saga where MJ is pregnant, and Peter let's Ben Reilly take the webs for a while. 
I love Miles and i'm so Happy that he is the main spider man!
This isn't real is it? And if it is. HAH! FUCK YES!
Good
Joyous, I get to skip a 3rd spider man game!
