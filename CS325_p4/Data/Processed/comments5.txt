I‚Äôve been a patron of Disney World for over 30 years. We are just finishing up three days in the parks and the magic might be gone for me. The experience is in decline and the costs have skyrocketed astronomically. Overall the staff are grumpy, the smiles are forced, and there isn‚Äôt any attempt to make guests feel special. They allow too many people in the parks creating longer wait times for everything and the Genie+ system is embarrassing and way over priced. It feels like Disney‚Äôs goal is no longer creating a magical experience but more about extracting as much money from each guest as possible. The food in the park is also in decline. Not a single meal was good. We ate at Chefs de France and the $400 meal was sadly pre cooked hours in advance and kept in warming trays. Sorry for the rant, I‚Äôm just disappointed at the current state of a once special place.

Gene is going through a divorce and doesn‚Äôt need you yelling at him about Rise being down, he can‚Äôt help that no matter what his soon to be ex might tell you.
Gene only answers to one guy: Gene
True. For Gene. but how about Gene+?
isn't that just an overweight version of Gene?
No that‚Äôs the actualized version of Gene since Laura left him.
No, Gene+ is Gene after 6 months doing crossfit.
But does he talk about it nonstop 24/7 even after everyone has asked him to stop and told him they don't care?
At my church they out a plus after the name to show they are an ordained priest. So gene+ is know as Father Gene or Rev Gene.
Gene+ is Gene Simmons bitching about why it‚Äôs not his face on the app.

I don‚Äôt know why everyone gets so defensive about bad park experiences. 
I think people also read "the experience is getting worse" as "the experience is bad" which are two entirely different statements. I've noticed some things I do feel like are not as good as they used to be, but that doesn't mean I think Disney isn't fun anymore. I think these discussions are worthwhile and should be had. Iger at least recognizes some of the issue which is a good start, but my hope for them treating CMs better is unfortunately low. I hope it gets better though.
Unfortunately, I think it‚Äôs systemic. Better pay, yes, but work morale is universally bad in the service industry. It‚Äôs the zeitgeist of it, a culture of dissatisfaction (for good reason in many cases) that just disengages workers. 
I‚Äôve been in the restaurant industry for 20 years now, 10 in ownership, and you‚Äôve hit the nail on the head here. And as service industry people, we‚Äôre keen to seeing it. 
I love DW for the simplicity and safety. I have 4 kids, most are out of the house now, but I‚Äôve never had an easier and better family vacation than Disney. 
I‚Äôll speak broadly since I‚Äôm not super defensive of Disney, but he basically said everything is worse. You mentioned a specific rational problem that can affect several experiences and feel like everything is worse. That doesn‚Äôt feel over the top. But I personally feel his came off ‚Äúback in my day things were better.‚Äù Also - I was there last summer and I could definitely point at some things that should be improved, but I didn‚Äôt come away with anywhere near his level of irritation. So I anecdotally disagree with him.
I agree with you.
And it's only gonna keep getting worse if they keep refusing to pay CMs a decent wage
THIS RIGHT HERE!   So many people keep saying 'Then the CMs can find another job", but they are going to take the magic they create with them, and you are going to get people who are not passionate about their jobs in replacement.    
I agree with you, but it‚Äôs not an issue of losing good Cast Members. It‚Äôs an issue of the company culture shift at Disney. A good company culture can teach anyone how to be a ‚ÄúDisney CM‚Äù but a bad company culture, like the one that‚Äôs been developing for the past 9 or so years, equates to what we see today. And it‚Äôs only heightened by the recent pandemic. There is a lot more rude CMs these days than there‚Äôs ever been in the past.
[deleted]
Agreed. Lot of bored looking and inconsiderate CMs these days. Was here a few years ago, and it was much better all around.
Oh you mean the CM attitude. That's a hard thing to change I imagine, since your job description is basically, "Be nice to everyone, or else!" (paraphrasing) 
It's not THAT hard to change. It just costs a little bit of that thing that we all spend a whole lot of every time we visit. Money. Keep your employees happy, meaning well paid, benefits (not just health either), and support them. You'll be surprised what happens when people are happy with where they work.
While I'm not denying that the WDW experience has declined in recent years...you just visited during one of the busiest weeks of the year - the middle of Spring Break, which has historically  ALWAYS been packed.
You couldn‚Äôt pay me to go to WDW during peak times
If anyone wants to pay me to go, ill go
I‚Äôll give you a dollar to go.
It's Spring break in Orange County right now for elementary school kids.
We have always travelled during March break and Christmas because my wife is a teacher. All of my past experiences are during peak times.
The Orlando airport just had its busiest day ever.
MCO experience deteriorating.
Testify! That airport is terrible.
Being a local I actually do not mind it. Lol. Precheck is the way.
People are making up for missed vacations. It's been wild.
At first, but is that still the case?   I think all the people moving to Florida are buying annual passes and the locals are making it unbearable for the people who save for their once every 5-10 year trips.
Yes. Still. Think about it. It is always busy around this time a year, so you have that plus people who put off their disney trips for a couple of years. People are rescheduling them sporadically, and I think we will continue to see that for at least the rest of the year. But you're right, I'm sure the flood of people moving to Florida has contributed as well. I don't think it is any one thing. A lot of different things are coming together for the perfect storm. Regardless. It's crazy.
I‚Äôm with you here. I find the ‚Äúbut you went at a busy time‚Äù comments very unhelpful. Disney is always busy compared to almost anything else, even during their ‚Äúoff peak‚Äù seasons. It‚Äôs not unreasonable to expect good food, good service, and an enjoyable holiday during a peak season. You are paying for that privilege! You are correct to expect better.
Yeah I have to say that‚Äôs honestly rotten luck and I‚Äôm sorry that happened! We were there the week after Labor Day and everything was so chill and we had a wonderful time. 
As another teacher...we only get peak times off. Peak times are when school is out.
I realize that. My stepmom has been a teacher for nearly 20 years now. OP said they always do spring break and Christmas, there are other breaks times they could go even that aren‚Äôt quite as crazy as those two.
We went in October and it was wonderful. We did pay for all the extras and that was a little eye opening with costs but the only rides we had to wait longer than 30 minutes for were ones that had maintenance issues and broken down. 
When in October did you go? We are headed there during the 3rd full week of October because it coincides w/ my husband's work conference.  I'm really hoping that 1-1.5 weeks before Halloween it will also be fairly chill? * pretty please *
First week the 3rd thru the 9th I think?  It was also no weekend.
Y'all are allowed to use more than 2 vacation days in a row without a doctor's note?
Absolutely. They are our vacation days not sick days.
Lucky! We get 5 personal days (and we get sick days) but you can only use one at a time. If you have special circumstances you can plead your case but vacation would not win their favor.
We get 2 personal days and 10 sick days. (3+ days in a row needs a note.) I wish we got more personal days.
I was there from October 4-12 and it was horrible compared to what it used to be. Like OP said, the staff was miserable, the food sucked and the amount of people was gross. Not to mention they upped the price of genie + half way through. It‚Äôs simply not what it used to be and Im not confident that it will get any better
Went March 2022 for SB (first trip after 35'ish years, and after 2 year delay due to Covid), had a great time. I'm more apt to believe the OP in this case. Yeah it's the worse time, but I imagine after 30 years they have an expectation level and I wouldn't dismiss than WDW is missing the mark these days.
while you went during the worst possible time, cast members are fighting for a living wage. they are all overworked, underpaid, and burnt out from getting screamed at on the daily by guests who want a magical moment and demanding it. cast members are the magic and deserve better.
Just back from Disney - was very disappointing and agree with your comments.  Tried LL twice in two rides we really wanted and both times they were broke down.  We didn‚Äôt get the value we wanted since we missed out on those two rides we really wanted.  Miss the old system and annual pass with ability to go to different parks without time restrictions.  Plus on property no more in-room dining which was a complete bummer after two day drive.  Had to go back out and get food.  Seems perks keep dwindling but cost is way up ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
And they‚Äôre making more money than ever and the parks are always full. The experience will continue to dwindle because people are going to go just for the brand name. Take your money to universal, they‚Äôve actually invested in a ton of improvements.
and hired a lot of ex-disney talent.
A lot of my old team at Disney went to Uni. There‚Äôs still a lot left to accomplish over the next few years too! Very tempting.
I thought the same thing when I was there. Where‚Äôs the motivation for Disney to improve, the parks are jammed.
During covid, Disney stopped all projects because they didn't have proper income. Their current problem is that they need to refurbish rides and make marked infrastructure changes, but their parks are too busy, and again, they have that anti work mindset if they don't see profits. 
Not all projects were stopped btw. Still a lot of coned projects still went full steam ahead.
Universal will be their motivation. Once their new theme park opens its going to create some serious competition.
Those are two very different experiences. Universal is good at what it does, but it's not a DW substitute by any means.
Interesting perspective. I was just there Thursday through Sunday and enjoyed myself. All the cast members were pleasant to outgoing. Sunday was busy with it being the start of the spring break but I used the crazy afternoon to watch the parades and enjoy all the AC attractions that really never had much of wait. To me coming out of the Hall of Presidents to a cavalcade of characters just coming by is the magic. The magic is getting on a new ride or enjoying an old favorite. Seeing the safari in the late afternoon in perfect weather while ppl from home text me pics of the snow coming down. I‚Äôm sorry the magic is gone for you, but to me the magic is still there and up to me to enjoy it.
Chef‚Äôs de France has been serving assembly line overpriced garbage for years. The 3 course prix fixe dinner was just under $20 less than 15 years ago, and now is in the $60+ dollar range. If you look at the items ala carte prices, there is no savings, other than the glass of rotgut wine they now include. Not to mention the food is processed and left to sit under a heat lamp awaiting service, like at a fast food joint. 
Me and my family has always loved Via Napoli in the Italy pavilion. There are a few dishes on that menu that are legitimately amazing. We also always enjoy Brown Derby and Shula‚Äôs for our splurge meals.
Shulas is fantastic. Give Todd English Bluezoo a try if you get a chance. Outstanding seafood and service. 
I may be in the minority but I had be of the best salmon meals at Chefs de France last year- it n fact 5 of us all really enjoyed our meals. Maybe we just got lucky!! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
This is WDW dining. Some people don‚Äôt know any better and love it. If you do you deal with it or get a burger.
It's ok for your interests to change over the years. 30 years, going multiple times a year, is a lot of exposure to the same thing. Add in the higher cost and of course it's going to leave a sour taste in your mouth. If you've phased out of Disney, then skip it for a year or two. It'll still be there if you decide to jump back in to going several years down the road. Maybe by then they will have resolved some of the problems you've experienced (or maybe you won't care as much if they are still around). Either way, as with everything in life, things are going to change and the stuff that holds a special place in your mind from 20 years ago will always fall short of what's there now. 
Best comment on this entire post!
Yep!
Just went for my first time in 20 years the other week and thought it was all fantastic!!  Sure the Genie+ was slightly confusing to navigate at first but once we got it, I thought it made the experience much more enjoyable.  Already looking at going back next year!
Currently at WDW. Animal Kingdom Lodge is lovely and a peaceful place to rest and renew. This is day five, and we‚Äôve done all of the parks. It‚Äôs been fabulous‚Äîand Genie + was so helpful. The food has actually better than I remember.  No more chicken strips or a burger. Lots of culturally diverse options, fresh fruits, vegan and veggie selections, fantastic cold brews, and creative adult beverages. It‚Äôs expensive‚Äîit absolutely is. It‚Äôs crowded this week‚Äîit absolutely is. We‚Äôve received extraordinarily friendly and personalized service on many occasions. EPCOT was simply stunning in all its floral glory!
Animal Kingdom Lodge is the best place I‚Äôve ever stayed. Spent my honeymoon there in one of the safari facing villas and nothing beats drinking a cup of coffee early in the morning while a family of giraffes eats 20 feet away.
Looking at them as I type this!
Right there with you. My wife, daughter, aunt and cousin went in February and we had just the best time. My aunt and I got a kick out of how convoluted the lightning lane and genie+ were. It was like a game to us to decipher it all‚Ä¶a few days in we got the hang of it, although we never really found a great day to take full advantage of genie +‚Ä¶arguably overthinking the optimization of it a bit. 
gotta watch a few tutorials on youtube and you'll get it immediately. we did 13 rides 10 of which were genie+ from 9:30am-9pm.
I‚Äôm glad you had a nice time and these complaints do not take away from it ‚Äì but I don‚Äôt want to play a game of analysis and strategy and optimization that costs me money. It‚Äôs a day at Disney World. Why are they asking me to make appointments and do scheduling work for them? Why do I pay to do that?
Then don‚Äôt do it‚Ä¶it‚Äôs completely optional.
I feel the same way. We were just at MK in Feb (before the cheer comps started) and vs 2019 with the old fast pass system we had a much better time. I could purchase Mine Train and finally ride it... in the past it was always sold out for fast pass weeks in advance by ppl staying on property. Genie + evened out the playing field and I think the die hards who stay on property are salty about it IMO.
One thing to remember is to compliment the cast members that do go the extra mile. You can do it right there inside the My Disney Experience app. I don't know exactly what the benefit is, but the couple of times I've mentioned it the CM really seems to appreciate it.
The rant is common these days and warranted. The last two trips I have gone on has felt the same way. It was such a special place like no where else. I have so many good memories over the past 30+ myself, except the last two. It makes me really depressed.
I was just there and I was actually thinking to myself how affordable Genie+ is. $15 is a steal.
It was $29 per person this week.
Ahh, well I wouldn‚Äôt have thought that was a steal then. That‚Äôs too bad, it was $15 when I was there a month ago.
So $15 a person. Let's pretend a family of 4, so $60 a day.  Let's say you go for 5 days...an extra $300 to your vacation that used to be absolutely free.  Affordable is relative.  It literally used to be free.  How is $15 affordable when something used to be free?  Just curious....
That‚Äôs fair. I only had to pay for myself and was only at the parks one day, so for me, I was happy to pay to maximize my time. I got to see three parks in one day instead of paying for two days of parks, and saved money overall for that. Didn‚Äôt realize it used to be free though, so could understand that being frustrating now. Were the lightning lines as efficient then though compared to now?
I‚Äôve mainly noticed the change with employees. I don‚Äôt blame them in the slightest but that Disney magic, we make your dreams come true vibe is gone. They look miserable and have attitudes
Totally agree. Staff are happy when they are treated with respect and paid well. It‚Äôs not a people problem it‚Äôs a Disney corporate issue.
Bet all of the good CMs have left‚Ä¶seen this too many times at corporate, those who actually care are treated like replaceable crap until they leave, and it‚Äôs just never the same after‚Ä¶but upper level management has their heads in their you know what!
Agree completely. I think overselling admission to the park is the biggest cause of the huge decline in quality. Unfortunate that they refuse to reduce the overcrowding. They have tried to throw Genie+ at the problem but ultimately the only solutions are letting fewer people into the park or another gate to deal with demand.
You want them to cap attendance lower I‚Äôm sure that would be a popular move.
It would only be an issue for people that don't like planning ahead. And honestly, people that are willing to put in the time and effort to plan out their Disney trips months out deserve to have a better experience in return, even if it comes at the cost of people whose typical Disney visit is often done on a whim.
Lower attendance caps and higher prices. You sure are saying a lot of things I‚Äôll give you that.
Nice contribution to the discussion - downvoting people you disagree with and giving sarcastic replies with no counterargument. Great job.
Okay I‚Äôm having a little fun with this but your position isn‚Äôt popular! Most folks want more capacity and lower prices and also for no one else to be in line for Mine Train. We aren‚Äôt a logical bunch.  
I don't think the situation is dire. And furthermore, if people don't like how it is then there is nothing forcing them to go. But I did agree with OP that lowering the attendance cap would make it more enjoyable.
Yes I‚Äôm local AP. I don‚Äôt mind the caps And any concern about that is mostly gone with the new rules where I can go after 2 PM any day. But I also don‚Äôt mind crowds because any given day for us is never do or die. Soarin is a zoo? Maybe next time. 
I get that. A lot more is at stake for people flying in for their once-a-year/decade/lifetime trip. The crowds are definitely not as enjoyable of an experience for that type of guest as they may be for you.
Iger has admitted as much. He recently did an interview where he stated that the parks have been too aggressive with price hikes. He also brought back one decent perk: complimentary parking at WDW resorts. Hopefully he continues to try to improve the customer experience.
He also brought back one decent perk: complimentary parking at WDW resorts.
Don‚Äôt give them any ideas :)
We went there for a week last year and I totally agree.  WAY too crowded and too expensive.  The Genie+ system as it relates to meals is simply preposterous.  We struggled to get reservations at restaurants at our hotel.  I don't know how you can have a hotel and not have enough spots for dinner, but they seem to have done it.
Not seeing the connection between G+ and dining reservations
Whilst one anecdotal experience doesn‚Äôt detract from another, I went last summer, and it was as magical as ever. Me and my entire family loved it!!!
Totally agree. Everyone will have a different experience for a number of factors.  Maybe my expectations were too high, or memories inaccurate of past experiences.
You can't complain about the crowds being too big and the costs being too high. The only way to reduce the crowds would be to raise the prices or severely limit the number of people via the Park Pass Reservation system (which people also complain about).
They have raised prices, but it hasn't really reduced demand.  I don't think they should raise prices any further as it would just lead to anger at paying more for a still crowded park.
Why are all these PEOPLE at this place I‚Äôm at?!?
Me every single time I go to Costco ü§£
"Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded."
This guy Yogi Berras.
There is one another way- expand to meet the demand.
They used to build rides and parks and restaurants and shows to meet demand. Now they just charge more. See how that works?
Expansion costs money and brings more people helping neither the cost nor the crowd complaints. If you want Disney to both lower prices while also capping tickets they can't afford expansion.
And they still build rides and restaurants.
You're not the only one who feels that way OP, it's been on a decline for several years now. We were APs for 10 years and loved being able to go to the parks after work just for a quick ride and dinner. This used to be affordable, there wasn't an agonizing wait time for whatever ride we choose. We would simply roll the dice and decide which park to go to and just go. Now we have to pray a reservation is available to still find ourselves rubbing shoulders with other people. It's too much. It doesn't matter what time of the year, what time in the day, or what park you go to, it's just simply overcrowded. Needless to say we cancelled our renewal for the parks, something we truly miss but it no longer brings magic to our lives. We hated feeling like sardines in can. 
Last time I went a few years ago it was too crowded and difficult to do anything.
While I disagree w you about Disney I still do really miss you on the stern show.
Loved him in Dirty Work
and Mad TV
Crazy that he and pops are still alive but norm and Bob are gone
And it‚Äôs on appointment. And it costs more. And the cast members are living in their cars.
I don‚Äôt go to Disney World often as I live in California but I had a similar experience on Monday at Disneyland and DCA. They are just allowing wayyyyy too many people in the parks now and Genie+ isn‚Äôt even worth it.
I went for the first time (at 38yo) in November of 2018. My wife and I went back last January, and it was not the same just in that short time. Last year was very tense, the cast members didn't seem to give a crap about anything, and many of the guests were more angry and entitled than I've ever seen people at any amusement park. That's not even touching on the cost difference. We realized after our trip that we could've gone on a week long, all inclusive safari through a resort in South Africa for about the same amount we spent at WDW for five days.
It feels like Disney‚Äôs goal is no longer creating a magical experience but more about extracting as much money from each guest as possible.
It‚Äôs not as ‚Äúmagical‚Äù as it used to be. I used to enjoy being in the parks and disconnecting from the world. Now i feel like I‚Äôm glued to my phone and a schedule.
I just left and did not have this experience. Everything was better than I expected and we made some amazing memories.
I will agree. I went in 2016 and it had that "disney magic" feeling and experience. Then when I went in 2021 it was noticeable that there was a shift. Everything was costing more, staff was grumpy, and most people there seemed miserable. Next time I'm in Orlando I want to check out Universal and compare my experiences.
I suggest you never, ever go to Disneyland Paris because, in comparison, Walt Disney World is an absolute dream!
Went with wife and daughters for their first time recently, and my first time in 25 years. 
Been going a minimum of once annually for 30 years and my main problem with recent trips is the nickel and diming.
Agree on the phone. What did you feel was nickel and dimed?
The very first thing was paying for parking in 80% empty lots.  Fortunately, that‚Äôs recently been eliminated.
We went in 2021 and did all the special fancy dining things because it was mine and my kids first time. I mean we did ALL OF THEM. Several thousands of dollars worth of reservations. The only decent meal was Cinderella‚Äôs castle. We had much better food with the basic cheap dining pass at Universal than Disney. Some of the experiences in the restaurant were cool but we expected much better food for the prices. Next time we will skip most of that. 
Reading things like this has me worried. I‚Äôve been there many times, but it‚Äôs been 5 years since I last went. I always go in the off season and most lines are 10-20 mins, the worst may be 40 mins. But I haven‚Äôt been there in 5 years and planned to go in September right after school starts this year‚Ä¶.
My family and I (myself, wife, 2, and 4 y/o) went last September and had a magical trip.
We just came home yesterday and for us, the magic is definitely still going strong. Sure we spent a lot on tickets and genie+ and ILL, but since rides and general ambiance were our priorities, we went cheap on food and drinks and souvenirs. (QS, groceries for breakfast, sharing snacks.) Balance is the name of the game.
I‚Äôve been numerous times last year and this year. It‚Äôs not a bad time. Things have changed, obviously, but it‚Äôs what you make it ya know? You and your family will have a great time I‚Äôm sure. üòä
I don‚Äôt want to take away from your experience. September should be less crowded. But your total cost will be roughly twice what is was 5 years ago. If you can pack some food to skip buying lunch and have lower expectations for dinner it will be more enjoyable. Some of my disappointment maybe that I had high expectations for the experience. On the plus side the fireworks have never been better.
Same. I am worried too! Going at the end of June for the first time in 12 years!
I wouldn't worry too much. I think the main issue is with unrealistic expectations.
I went in May and had a great time despite the changes! The magic was still there for me and plenty of people in this sub. 
It‚Äôs probably always been about extracting as much money from each person, you were just younger and more care free 30 years ago
Is anyone else tired of these posts?
Sorry I didn‚Äôt know they were common.
$400 meal!    yikes!    no wonder you're disappointed!
I still remember my godawful hot dog at Liberty Market Square. The bun had this weird texture and composure that felt more like slime and while I ate it I felt like I was eating the Shoggoth alive. As fun as my trip was last year, I can still get the points of what you mean on this post. I just remember the declining food quality the most vividly.
I visited in Feb and I have to agree. It's been many years since I was last there, but it was quite disappointing regardless.
Had the same experience during our last visit. I'm used to paying more every time. But the combination of a worse experience, paying more at the gate, and then having to pay for things that used to be included (fast pass) - I really felt like I was getting screwed. I'm the last, I felt like I was paying a lot for a premium experience and was ok with that. No longer true for me.
The whole world is deteriorating. Maybe it's just me turning into the get off my lawn guy. Unfortunately Disney still does it better than anyone else as far as theme parks go in my opinion. The bar is lowering but they maintain the high point.
Busiest day at MCO wasn't only spring breakers. But also part of March Madness is in Orlando as well for today through Sunday. So I'm sure people took a week off for that as well. And then I'm sure the day(s) their team isn't playing, families will go to Disney. So yes, Disney will be packed.
Agreed
We went in October -- second family trip to Disney. My kids were aggravated with the long lines and my wife and I had a really hard time putting the price out of our thoughts. 
Universal hotels also seem way cheaper. Still pricy but more affordable than Disney.
We stayed 3 nights at Universal but we stayed offsite for Disney so this is a little like comparing cheeseburgers to apples but bear with me.   
Yep. Went last year and just couldn‚Äôt feel the magic. exact same reasons as you plus the first time in my life I‚Äôve had rides break mid ride. Multiple rides.
Really feels like I read this exact post like 3-4 months ago.  And to add, there's zero chance my dinner at Chef de France last April was in a warming tray. Excellent french onion soup and a perfectly cooked filet.
This subreddit showed up for me for some reason with this specific post. I‚Äôve never been to Disney World but I live in LA and I can definitely say the same for Disneyland and California Adventure. First, there is never a season when the park is not crowded AF. There used to be down seasons when locals/Disney devotees/Annual Pass Holders loved to go because the crowds were much thinner. That‚Äôs almost never the case these days. Second, yes, the magic is just gone. It‚Äôs still a fun park but those little interactions or experiences with cast members, they‚Äôre just not there anymore.  Also, everything worth doing is booked up weeks in advance. You can‚Äôt be spontaneous about where you‚Äôll eat or some of the attractions. And finally, yes Genie + has ruined the parks. You spend so much time on your phone trying to figure out what ride isn‚Äôt too long of a wait that you really don‚Äôt ‚Äúexperience‚Äù the park anymore; you just plan your way to get through the day.
I‚Äôll join the pile on Chefs de France. I was there a few weeks back for my first visit. I was really looking forward to it, but boy, that was disappointing. My chicken was so dry I felt like I was eating the turkey from the dinner scene in Christmas Vacation.
It was my first time to WDW and I was disappointed. The food wasn‚Äôt great and expensive, the type of souvenirs was cheap and juvenile, especially compared to Tokyo Disneyland. The rides were really boring and the atmosphere didn‚Äôt really draw me in. We actually went during a quieter time and it was still too many people
Really don‚Äôt wanna state the obvious but after 30yrs it‚Äôs natural to think ‚Äúit‚Äôs not like the good old days‚Äù. 
For me, I don‚Äôt think the problem is so much that they let too many people into the parks as much as it is the fact that all the new rides have terribly designed ride ques from the standpoint of capacity management. The parks feel full because the rides don‚Äôt accommodate as many riders as they used to. In reality the parks still haven‚Äôt reached pre pandemic numbers of visitors, but yet, the lines are all longer than ever. But in that sense, yes I agree, they let to many people into the parks. Especially because the parks can no longer handle the crowds it used to handle :(
I grew up going to Disney World and I was fortunate enough to have grandparents that would take our family ever couple of years. My grandparents were some if the original DVC members and we enjoyed that even up until about 8 years ago. As an adult I was able to bring all 3 of my kids to experience the magic that I grew up loving. In 2021 we booked a family trip to Disney World and I have to say that the lines and prices were just not worth it to me anymore. The original fast pass system was way better than what they have now and I just can‚Äôt justify spending almost $1k a DAY to take my family of 5 to a single park; it‚Äôs just too much and simply not affordable for a middle class family. We have no plans to return any time soon. I have some of my greatest memories from these family trips and it makes me sad to think that my kids won‚Äôt get to experience it the same way I once did. The original Disney World vision was to provide a great experience while being affordable; it is no longer this.
Or maybe you‚Äôve gone so much that the magic has gone for you? We went twice last year, and it was amazing. I hadn‚Äôt been for 10 years and my husband 20 years. We both said that if we were going all the time we would get bored of it and it wouldn‚Äôt feel as special.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs too many people‚Äù
‚ÄúGenie+ is overpriced‚Äù
I think the parks are as good as ever. Been going for almost 15 years and we‚Äôve probably been 100 times.  There are more rides, experiences, dining options, and unique experiences than ever before. 
It was special when I went last year. I don‚Äôt knows
So if there are too many people in the park, what is the solution? (And lord Jesus, it‚Äôs not to build another park‚Ä¶that will bring MORE people)
The solution is to not go. If you don‚Äôt enjoy it anymore, go somewhere else. Not as punishment to Disney, but because you don‚Äôt like it and want to try something new.
They could simply let less people into the park and accept lower profits. Maybe pay and treat the staff better? Disney has gotten greedy imo.
Sure they could. But is that how or form of business works? Which other company voluntarily cuts their customer base and lowers prices at the same time?
A good company that values long term sustainability over short term profits. Pure capitalism is a virus to the people and planet. We should not consider this acceptable.
So again, name a company that does that. Who is the model? Which public company does these things and doesn‚Äôt take a beating on its profits and earnings? This company is hemorrhaging money for different reasons. Yet everyone wants them to voluntarily bring in less with no real ROI on that decision. 
There are many companies that have values and still make solid profits. Costco comes to mind as a obvious one that is very successful.
Lol at values. Have a nice day.
The Disney Experience isn‚Äôt deteriorating. You‚Äôre getting older and wanting it to adapt to you. It needs to adapt to the youth. I can almost guarantee you every kid that‚Äôs going has the most magical time they could possibly have.
Both my kids wanted to leave early and felt the rides were dated. We travel to a fair amount of amusement parks so they know what‚Äôs available. I didn‚Äôt mention any of the costs to them so that didn‚Äôt factor into their enjoyment. I convinced them to stay for the fireworks because it‚Äôs always a highlight.
Agreed! The expectations grown people put on Disney is a little ridiculous. They want the old Disney Magic with fresh experiences that never change the existing attractions. In a sea of thousands of people, they want to feel special. The prices need to increase to keep some people out (and make it a "once-in-a-lifetime" experience again), but we don't want to be the ones to pay that fee. I don't know how anything can make this bar.
Agreed.
Here we go again‚Ä¶
In 2022 we went twice to Land. Spring break for 3 days, and Fall break for one. Worst Disney experience we‚Äôve ever had. Never again!
Went in July, took the family down. Even with a very pregnant wife, the oppressive heat, and a 2 year old, we had a fantastic time and had a lot of fun interactions. We intend to go back when our youngest (The bun in the oven in July) ages up a bit. 
Just here to say I love genie+ and it‚Äôs the best thing disney ever did in my opinion and my travel style
Works for us too.  It‚Äôs a great deal for offsite guests especially.
Sadly, not even Disney is exempt from the absolutely dismal consequences of having to hire 20 somethings. A desire to provide any kind of decent customer service and possessing some type of work ethic is gone. üôÅ We saw it a year ago when we were there with our kids.
I haven‚Äôt been to Disney World in a while, but you can tell in general Disney has gone down hill. 
I worked at the stores many years and they taught you what Disney was about, so my following rant is based on what Disney was and clearly now is. 
Question, how much more do eggs and milk cost in your area prior to COVID?  Just saying‚Ä¶ inflation and over demand‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Why is genie+ embarrassing? It's exactly the same as fast pass just with a small cost.
Poorly implemented, requires too much customer time and interaction, average guest only uses it 2 to 3 times a day, and $30 per ticket more is too much for what you receive. I  prefer the way roller coaster parks implement fast passes.
It literally is exactly the same as fastpass was just with a small cost. So wasn't anything to implement except change the name and add the cost. 
$30 or $370, it‚Äôs a bullshit cash grab at either price.
Welcome to every theme park in the entire world.
Totally agree.
[deleted]
The cost is somewhat meaningless to me, but I still do appreciate some value. My main issue is the lack of magic. They really need to solve the staff morale problems. It‚Äôs hard to be magical when the staff couldn‚Äôt care less about their work.
and there isn‚Äôt any attempt to make guests feel special
‚ÄúGene+‚Äù
I don‚Äôt know why everyone gets so defensive about bad park experiences. 
And it's only gonna keep getting worse if they keep refusing to pay CMs a decent wage
While I'm not denying that the WDW experience has declined in recent years...you just visited during one of the busiest weeks of the year - the middle of Spring Break, which has historically  ALWAYS been packed.
while you went during the worst possible time, cast members are fighting for a living wage. they are all overworked, underpaid, and burnt out from getting screamed at on the daily by guests who want a magical moment and demanding it. cast members are the magic and deserve better.
Just back from Disney - was very disappointing and agree with your comments.  Tried LL twice in two rides we really wanted and both times they were broke down.  We didn‚Äôt get the value we wanted since we missed out on those two rides we really wanted.  Miss the old system and annual pass with ability to go to different parks without time restrictions.  Plus on property no more in-room dining which was a complete bummer after two day drive.  Had to go back out and get food.  Seems perks keep dwindling but cost is way up ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
And they‚Äôre making more money than ever and the parks are always full. The experience will continue to dwindle because people are going to go just for the brand name. Take your money to universal, they‚Äôve actually invested in a ton of improvements.
Interesting perspective. I was just there Thursday through Sunday and enjoyed myself. All the cast members were pleasant to outgoing. Sunday was busy with it being the start of the spring break but I used the crazy afternoon to watch the parades and enjoy all the AC attractions that really never had much of wait. To me coming out of the Hall of Presidents to a cavalcade of characters just coming by is the magic. The magic is getting on a new ride or enjoying an old favorite. Seeing the safari in the late afternoon in perfect weather while ppl from home text me pics of the snow coming down. I‚Äôm sorry the magic is gone for you, but to me the magic is still there and up to me to enjoy it.
Chef‚Äôs de France has been serving assembly line overpriced garbage for years. The 3 course prix fixe dinner was just under $20 less than 15 years ago, and now is in the $60+ dollar range. If you look at the items ala carte prices, there is no savings, other than the glass of rotgut wine they now include. Not to mention the food is processed and left to sit under a heat lamp awaiting service, like at a fast food joint. 
One thing to remember is to compliment the cast members that do go the extra mile. You can do it right there inside the My Disney Experience app. I don't know exactly what the benefit is, but the couple of times I've mentioned it the CM really seems to appreciate it.
It's ok for your interests to change over the years. 30 years, going multiple times a year, is a lot of exposure to the same thing. Add in the higher cost and of course it's going to leave a sour taste in your mouth. If you've phased out of Disney, then skip it for a year or two. It'll still be there if you decide to jump back in to going several years down the road. Maybe by then they will have resolved some of the problems you've experienced (or maybe you won't care as much if they are still around). Either way, as with everything in life, things are going to change and the stuff that holds a special place in your mind from 20 years ago will always fall short of what's there now. 
Just went for my first time in 20 years the other week and thought it was all fantastic!!  Sure the Genie+ was slightly confusing to navigate at first but once we got it, I thought it made the experience much more enjoyable.  Already looking at going back next year!
The rant is common these days and warranted. The last two trips I have gone on has felt the same way. It was such a special place like no where else. I have so many good memories over the past 30+ myself, except the last two. It makes me really depressed.
I was just there and I was actually thinking to myself how affordable Genie+ is. $15 is a steal.
I‚Äôve mainly noticed the change with employees. I don‚Äôt blame them in the slightest but that Disney magic, we make your dreams come true vibe is gone. They look miserable and have attitudes
Agree completely. I think overselling admission to the park is the biggest cause of the huge decline in quality. Unfortunate that they refuse to reduce the overcrowding. They have tried to throw Genie+ at the problem but ultimately the only solutions are letting fewer people into the park or another gate to deal with demand.
Iger has admitted as much. He recently did an interview where he stated that the parks have been too aggressive with price hikes. He also brought back one decent perk: complimentary parking at WDW resorts. Hopefully he continues to try to improve the customer experience.
I went for the first time (at 38yo) in November of 2018. My wife and I went back last January, and it was not the same just in that short time. Last year was very tense, the cast members didn't seem to give a crap about anything, and many of the guests were more angry and entitled than I've ever seen people at any amusement park. That's not even touching on the cost difference. We realized after our trip that we could've gone on a week long, all inclusive safari through a resort in South Africa for about the same amount we spent at WDW for five days.
It‚Äôs not as ‚Äúmagical‚Äù as it used to be. I used to enjoy being in the parks and disconnecting from the world. Now i feel like I‚Äôm glued to my phone and a schedule.
We went there for a week last year and I totally agree.  WAY too crowded and too expensive.  The Genie+ system as it relates to meals is simply preposterous.  We struggled to get reservations at restaurants at our hotel.  I don't know how you can have a hotel and not have enough spots for dinner, but they seem to have done it.
Whilst one anecdotal experience doesn‚Äôt detract from another, I went last summer, and it was as magical as ever. Me and my entire family loved it!!!
You're not the only one who feels that way OP, it's been on a decline for several years now. We were APs for 10 years and loved being able to go to the parks after work just for a quick ride and dinner. This used to be affordable, there wasn't an agonizing wait time for whatever ride we choose. We would simply roll the dice and decide which park to go to and just go. Now we have to pray a reservation is available to still find ourselves rubbing shoulders with other people. It's too much. It doesn't matter what time of the year, what time in the day, or what park you go to, it's just simply overcrowded. Needless to say we cancelled our renewal for the parks, something we truly miss but it no longer brings magic to our lives. We hated feeling like sardines in can. 
You can't complain about the crowds being too big and the costs being too high. The only way to reduce the crowds would be to raise the prices or severely limit the number of people via the Park Pass Reservation system (which people also complain about).
Last time I went a few years ago it was too crowded and difficult to do anything.
While I disagree w you about Disney I still do really miss you on the stern show.
We went in 2021 and did all the special fancy dining things because it was mine and my kids first time. I mean we did ALL OF THEM. Several thousands of dollars worth of reservations. The only decent meal was Cinderella‚Äôs castle. We had much better food with the basic cheap dining pass at Universal than Disney. Some of the experiences in the restaurant were cool but we expected much better food for the prices. Next time we will skip most of that. 
And it‚Äôs on appointment. And it costs more. And the cast members are living in their cars.
I don‚Äôt go to Disney World often as I live in California but I had a similar experience on Monday at Disneyland and DCA. They are just allowing wayyyyy too many people in the parks now and Genie+ isn‚Äôt even worth it.
It feels like Disney‚Äôs goal is no longer creating a magical experience but more about extracting as much money from each guest as possible.
We went in October -- second family trip to Disney. My kids were aggravated with the long lines and my wife and I had a really hard time putting the price out of our thoughts. 
Yep. Went last year and just couldn‚Äôt feel the magic. exact same reasons as you plus the first time in my life I‚Äôve had rides break mid ride. Multiple rides.
I just left and did not have this experience. Everything was better than I expected and we made some amazing memories.
This subreddit showed up for me for some reason with this specific post. I‚Äôve never been to Disney World but I live in LA and I can definitely say the same for Disneyland and California Adventure. First, there is never a season when the park is not crowded AF. There used to be down seasons when locals/Disney devotees/Annual Pass Holders loved to go because the crowds were much thinner. That‚Äôs almost never the case these days. Second, yes, the magic is just gone. It‚Äôs still a fun park but those little interactions or experiences with cast members, they‚Äôre just not there anymore.  Also, everything worth doing is booked up weeks in advance. You can‚Äôt be spontaneous about where you‚Äôll eat or some of the attractions. And finally, yes Genie + has ruined the parks. You spend so much time on your phone trying to figure out what ride isn‚Äôt too long of a wait that you really don‚Äôt ‚Äúexperience‚Äù the park anymore; you just plan your way to get through the day.
I will agree. I went in 2016 and it had that "disney magic" feeling and experience. Then when I went in 2021 it was noticeable that there was a shift. Everything was costing more, staff was grumpy, and most people there seemed miserable. Next time I'm in Orlando I want to check out Universal and compare my experiences.
I suggest you never, ever go to Disneyland Paris because, in comparison, Walt Disney World is an absolute dream!
For me, I don‚Äôt think the problem is so much that they let too many people into the parks as much as it is the fact that all the new rides have terribly designed ride ques from the standpoint of capacity management. The parks feel full because the rides don‚Äôt accommodate as many riders as they used to. In reality the parks still haven‚Äôt reached pre pandemic numbers of visitors, but yet, the lines are all longer than ever. But in that sense, yes I agree, they let to many people into the parks. Especially because the parks can no longer handle the crowds it used to handle :(
Went with wife and daughters for their first time recently, and my first time in 25 years. 
Reading things like this has me worried. I‚Äôve been there many times, but it‚Äôs been 5 years since I last went. I always go in the off season and most lines are 10-20 mins, the worst may be 40 mins. But I haven‚Äôt been there in 5 years and planned to go in September right after school starts this year‚Ä¶.
It‚Äôs probably always been about extracting as much money from each person, you were just younger and more care free 30 years ago
Is anyone else tired of these posts?
$400 meal!    yikes!    no wonder you're disappointed!
I still remember my godawful hot dog at Liberty Market Square. The bun had this weird texture and composure that felt more like slime and while I ate it I felt like I was eating the Shoggoth alive. As fun as my trip was last year, I can still get the points of what you mean on this post. I just remember the declining food quality the most vividly.
I visited in Feb and I have to agree. It's been many years since I was last there, but it was quite disappointing regardless.
Had the same experience during our last visit. I'm used to paying more every time. But the combination of a worse experience, paying more at the gate, and then having to pay for things that used to be included (fast pass) - I really felt like I was getting screwed. I'm the last, I felt like I was paying a lot for a premium experience and was ok with that. No longer true for me.
The whole world is deteriorating. Maybe it's just me turning into the get off my lawn guy. Unfortunately Disney still does it better than anyone else as far as theme parks go in my opinion. The bar is lowering but they maintain the high point.
Busiest day at MCO wasn't only spring breakers. But also part of March Madness is in Orlando as well for today through Sunday. So I'm sure people took a week off for that as well. And then I'm sure the day(s) their team isn't playing, families will go to Disney. So yes, Disney will be packed.
Agreed
Really feels like I read this exact post like 3-4 months ago.  And to add, there's zero chance my dinner at Chef de France last April was in a warming tray. Excellent french onion soup and a perfectly cooked filet.
I‚Äôll join the pile on Chefs de France. I was there a few weeks back for my first visit. I was really looking forward to it, but boy, that was disappointing. My chicken was so dry I felt like I was eating the turkey from the dinner scene in Christmas Vacation.
It was my first time to WDW and I was disappointed. The food wasn‚Äôt great and expensive, the type of souvenirs was cheap and juvenile, especially compared to Tokyo Disneyland. The rides were really boring and the atmosphere didn‚Äôt really draw me in. We actually went during a quieter time and it was still too many people
Really don‚Äôt wanna state the obvious but after 30yrs it‚Äôs natural to think ‚Äúit‚Äôs not like the good old days‚Äù. 
I grew up going to Disney World and I was fortunate enough to have grandparents that would take our family ever couple of years. My grandparents were some if the original DVC members and we enjoyed that even up until about 8 years ago. As an adult I was able to bring all 3 of my kids to experience the magic that I grew up loving. In 2021 we booked a family trip to Disney World and I have to say that the lines and prices were just not worth it to me anymore. The original fast pass system was way better than what they have now and I just can‚Äôt justify spending almost $1k a DAY to take my family of 5 to a single park; it‚Äôs just too much and simply not affordable for a middle class family. We have no plans to return any time soon. I have some of my greatest memories from these family trips and it makes me sad to think that my kids won‚Äôt get to experience it the same way I once did. The original Disney World vision was to provide a great experience while being affordable; it is no longer this.
Or maybe you‚Äôve gone so much that the magic has gone for you? We went twice last year, and it was amazing. I hadn‚Äôt been for 10 years and my husband 20 years. We both said that if we were going all the time we would get bored of it and it wouldn‚Äôt feel as special.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs too many people‚Äù
‚ÄúGenie+ is overpriced‚Äù
I think the parks are as good as ever. Been going for almost 15 years and we‚Äôve probably been 100 times.  There are more rides, experiences, dining options, and unique experiences than ever before. 
I haven‚Äôt been to Disney World in a while, but you can tell in general Disney has gone down hill. 
I worked at the stores many years and they taught you what Disney was about, so my following rant is based on what Disney was and clearly now is. 
It was special when I went last year. I don‚Äôt knows
So if there are too many people in the park, what is the solution? (And lord Jesus, it‚Äôs not to build another park‚Ä¶that will bring MORE people)
The Disney Experience isn‚Äôt deteriorating. You‚Äôre getting older and wanting it to adapt to you. It needs to adapt to the youth. I can almost guarantee you every kid that‚Äôs going has the most magical time they could possibly have.
Here we go again‚Ä¶
In 2022 we went twice to Land. Spring break for 3 days, and Fall break for one. Worst Disney experience we‚Äôve ever had. Never again!
Went in July, took the family down. Even with a very pregnant wife, the oppressive heat, and a 2 year old, we had a fantastic time and had a lot of fun interactions. We intend to go back when our youngest (The bun in the oven in July) ages up a bit. 
Just here to say I love genie+ and it‚Äôs the best thing disney ever did in my opinion and my travel style

Why is genie+ embarrassing? It's exactly the same as fast pass just with a small cost.
Totally agree.
[deleted]
and there isn‚Äôt any attempt to make guests feel special
It‚Äôs a business‚Ä¶ anyone that thinks it‚Äôs a magical place is foolish
Sadly the mouse has been all about the $$ for quite a while
Whine whine whine
How can it be both overpriced and too crowded? It can be one or the other. Clearly still attracting many, many people at current prices and crowd levels. I do agree that it sucks that things are getting more expensive, but that‚Äôs about it.
Then stop going. Stop supporting the garbage politics Florida too
Why would you go in the first place? I'd rather eat a bug. Disney's days are over and have been for some time now.
No doubt, the experience has declined and the costs are absurd, yet seems more popular than ever so probably not going to change much. I will say if done right you can maximize Genie+ pretty well but does take preparation and money.
I completely agree with you on most points (I‚Äôve had some good food at the resort), and every time someone makes this claim a bunch of people come out of the woodwork and say that it isn‚Äôt true. Disneyland is my home park, and I‚Äôve had the same experience there. Even just a few years ago in 2019 the overall experience was tremendously better.
I recommend watching the defunctland video on fastpass, in which you will learn that the reason for the insanely long lines is not, in fact, capacity, but rather they are caused by genie plus itself.
Understand the rant.  Just went through an excruciating time at the DMV.  But as far as Disney World my wife and I love it.  We go twice a year and spend a ton.  Disney Springs is great.  We‚Äôve been going since 1985.  It is not today what it was then, but then neither are we.
meanwhile, I'm watching all the unhappy guests while I enjoy my beer. that's almost worth the price of admission /s
I‚Äôm 40 years old and went about 6 times as a kid, and now I‚Äôve gone 5 times since having kids. Perhaps you‚Äôve gone too many times and it‚Äôs time to switch it up? I‚Äôm not denying your experience at all, but sometimes distance is worth it. 
Just stay out of magic kingdom and your good that is by far the busiest park and the buss system they use sucks.
We went for thanksgiving for the first time since I was 5 (I‚Äôm 39 now). Took my 5 year old son and 16 yo stepson and went with lots of family. 
In a sense it's been deteriorating steadily for 40 years -- I remember paying $15 to get into the park and some days weren't crowded at all. It's just a question of each person's threshold for paying more and getting less. I am about 15 years past it.
The only way it changes is if people stop going, and they won‚Äôt.
I find it interesting you mentioned low quality experience and the high pricing in the same post. Disney is saying that a high quality experience needs a high price. But it appears from your post the high price outstrips on what Disney can deliver in experience.
Genie+ is a great price for what you get. If you learn how to use it efficiently and make your first selection at 7am you can get on just about every ride in one day at MK. I had two kids w me so I didn't utilize it for rides they couldn't ride like Thunder Mountain but we got on everything else that was within their height requirements.  we skipped the line for everything except Its a Small World, Tea Cups and the Carousel bc those lines weren't long ever.
I recently read that the price increases are right on par with previous years increases and prices are right where they were projected to be years ago. With that said, they‚Äôve taken away a lot of ‚Äúperks‚Äù that used to be included (ie: magical express, fast pass) and added a lot of new features that you have to pay for if you want access (ie: Gene+ üòÇ).
How do you know your meal at chefs du France was cooked hours in advance and kept in warming trays? I can‚Äôt imagine your server telling someone this and it‚Äôs not like the kitchens are open. Could be wrong though! I‚Äôve only ever had great experiences there.
This narrative of the parks being busier than ever is hilarious to me. Disney is still not as busy as it was pre-pandemic. The parks are still at 85% capacity. People forget that FOP and 7DMT were 4 hour wait times on non peak days prior to COVID.
I went in late February and it was the best experience I‚Äôve had since 2016 and I go every year.
We were ‚Äúthis‚Äù close to buying into DVC, but the experience in the parks (bad food, poor service, low quality merch) convinced us not to.  Instead, we‚Äôre spending that money on cruising, some Disney, some not.
We just did our first Disney World trip and don't plan to ever do it again. Overall it was a very disappointing experience and nothing magical at all. Lesson learned.
I do agree that the dinners in the parks aren't up to snuff.... we ate at Skipper Canteen.... and then the next night at Three bridges.... and Three Bridges way WAY better.
Hopefully with Bob auger back he expressed some of the same concerns and downfalls. Hopefully he can fix some of those issues before his new predecessor comes in
I have never been to Disney World (I follow because I would love to one day) but I have been to Disney in Tokyo and Shanghai and I had a great time at borh without spending a fortune (and doing lots of research beforehand). Perhaps it might be worth considering them in future? (If the figures work out, obviously). It is a totally different experience than what Disney World sounds like but still very fun. And the cast members were all amazing.
I just went for five days a few weeks ago.  One of my kids has autism and another has an anxiety disorder.   If it was not for the DAS pass we would not have enjoyed it.  But, because of the DAS pass we had an amazing time.  We literally would not have been able to do a fifth of what we did without it.
I swear we have this discussion every week or so and somehow there are always people trying to defend Disney, or go full nihilist and just be like ‚Äúthey‚Äôre a company they can suck if they wanna‚Äù as if that‚Äôs a reasonable answer
Started with discontinuing Magical Express
Oh god.
Yup
Their whole check is going to rent I think I‚Äôd be grumpy too
Gene is going through a divorce and doesn‚Äôt need you yelling at him about Rise being down, he can‚Äôt help that no matter what his soon to be ex might tell you.

we dont talk about bruno
I think people also read "the experience is getting worse" as "the experience is bad" which are two entirely different statements. I've noticed some things I do feel like are not as good as they used to be, but that doesn't mean I think Disney isn't fun anymore. I think these discussions are worthwhile and should be had. Iger at least recognizes some of the issue which is a good start, but my hope for them treating CMs better is unfortunately low. I hope it gets better though.
I‚Äôve been in the restaurant industry for 20 years now, 10 in ownership, and you‚Äôve hit the nail on the head here. And as service industry people, we‚Äôre keen to seeing it. 
I‚Äôll speak broadly since I‚Äôm not super defensive of Disney, but he basically said everything is worse. You mentioned a specific rational problem that can affect several experiences and feel like everything is worse. That doesn‚Äôt feel over the top. But I personally feel his came off ‚Äúback in my day things were better.‚Äù Also - I was there last summer and I could definitely point at some things that should be improved, but I didn‚Äôt come away with anywhere near his level of irritation. So I anecdotally disagree with him.
People are defensive because we're paying out the nose.  The price has steadily increased while the quality of the experience has decreased.  It not hard to understand.
When is it not peak season? I'm not being sarcastic, I'm actually asking.
THIS RIGHT HERE!   So many people keep saying 'Then the CMs can find another job", but they are going to take the magic they create with them, and you are going to get people who are not passionate about their jobs in replacement.    
Oh you mean the CM attitude. That's a hard thing to change I imagine, since your job description is basically, "Be nice to everyone, or else!" (paraphrasing) 
So I‚Äôm not disagreeing on the wage
You couldn‚Äôt pay me to go to WDW during peak times
It's Spring break in Orange County right now for elementary school kids.
We have always travelled during March break and Christmas because my wife is a teacher. All of my past experiences are during peak times.
Went March 2022 for SB (first trip after 35'ish years, and after 2 year delay due to Covid), had a great time. I'm more apt to believe the OP in this case. Yeah it's the worse time, but I imagine after 30 years they have an expectation level and I wouldn't dismiss than WDW is missing the mark these days.
The weather has been good incredible though.  It has been busy, but it‚Äôs still managed better than universal.  We went there Tuesday and it was a packed dumpy mess.
Crowds that Disney knew about well ahead of time due to their "Reservation System" that they always congratulate themselves about are a poor excuse for pretty much every complaint the OP had.
When spring break over? Is next week still spring break?
I'm tempted to bring extra 5's and 10's with me to slip to the CMs when no one's looking on our honeymoon in May. I'm a service worker, too, and people have gotten WAY worse since COVID. I feel for them especially. CMs need to be pixie-dusted, too!
and hired a lot of ex-disney talent.
I thought the same thing when I was there. Where‚Äôs the motivation for Disney to improve, the parks are jammed.
Those are two very different experiences. Universal is good at what it does, but it's not a DW substitute by any means.
I take the kids to Busch gardens and they get to ride all the coasters several times in a day
Me and my family has always loved Via Napoli in the Italy pavilion. There are a few dishes on that menu that are legitimately amazing. We also always enjoy Brown Derby and Shula‚Äôs for our splurge meals.
I may be in the minority but I had be of the best salmon meals at Chefs de France last year- it n fact 5 of us all really enjoyed our meals. Maybe we just got lucky!! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
This is WDW dining. Some people don‚Äôt know any better and love it. If you do you deal with it or get a burger.
Best comment on this entire post!
Currently at WDW. Animal Kingdom Lodge is lovely and a peaceful place to rest and renew. This is day five, and we‚Äôve done all of the parks. It‚Äôs been fabulous‚Äîand Genie + was so helpful. The food has actually better than I remember.  No more chicken strips or a burger. Lots of culturally diverse options, fresh fruits, vegan and veggie selections, fantastic cold brews, and creative adult beverages. It‚Äôs expensive‚Äîit absolutely is. It‚Äôs crowded this week‚Äîit absolutely is. We‚Äôve received extraordinarily friendly and personalized service on many occasions. EPCOT was simply stunning in all its floral glory!
Right there with you. My wife, daughter, aunt and cousin went in February and we had just the best time. My aunt and I got a kick out of how convoluted the lightning lane and genie+ were. It was like a game to us to decipher it all‚Ä¶a few days in we got the hang of it, although we never really found a great day to take full advantage of genie +‚Ä¶arguably overthinking the optimization of it a bit. 
I feel the same way. We were just at MK in Feb (before the cheer comps started) and vs 2019 with the old fast pass system we had a much better time. I could purchase Mine Train and finally ride it... in the past it was always sold out for fast pass weeks in advance by ppl staying on property. Genie + evened out the playing field and I think the die hards who stay on property are salty about it IMO.
I also completely understand that everything is overpriced, but I guess we went and just thought ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs Disney.‚Äù  Didn‚Äôt ruin our experience because going to Disney is not a budget trip.  You want the experience, you pay for it.
It was $29 per person this week.
So $15 a person. Let's pretend a family of 4, so $60 a day.  Let's say you go for 5 days...an extra $300 to your vacation that used to be absolutely free.  Affordable is relative.  It literally used to be free.  How is $15 affordable when something used to be free?  Just curious....
Totally agree. Staff are happy when they are treated with respect and paid well. It‚Äôs not a people problem it‚Äôs a Disney corporate issue.
You want them to cap attendance lower I‚Äôm sure that would be a popular move.
He also brought back one decent perk: complimentary parking at WDW resorts.
Don‚Äôt give them any ideas :)
Not seeing the connection between G+ and dining reservations
Totally agree. Everyone will have a different experience for a number of factors.  Maybe my expectations were too high, or memories inaccurate of past experiences.
I love Busch gardens, my kids end up riding all the coasters several times before we leave. Nice water park too.
They have raised prices, but it hasn't really reduced demand.  I don't think they should raise prices any further as it would just lead to anger at paying more for a still crowded park.
Why are all these PEOPLE at this place I‚Äôm at?!?
There is one another way- expand to meet the demand.
They used to build rides and parks and restaurants and shows to meet demand. Now they just charge more. See how that works?
Loved him in Dirty Work
UOA and IOA are great‚Ä¶ but they, imo, don‚Äôt have staying power like WDW.  We went for 4 days to UOA and IOA and by day 3, we were all tired of it.  Too many screen rides and the parks are too small for that much time.  WDW shines for a week long trip, Universal would become incredibly stale.
Universal hotels also seem way cheaper. Still pricy but more affordable than Disney.
Been going a minimum of once annually for 30 years and my main problem with recent trips is the nickel and diming.
My family and I (myself, wife, 2, and 4 y/o) went last September and had a magical trip.
I don‚Äôt want to take away from your experience. September should be less crowded. But your total cost will be roughly twice what is was 5 years ago. If you can pack some food to skip buying lunch and have lower expectations for dinner it will be more enjoyable. Some of my disappointment maybe that I had high expectations for the experience. On the plus side the fireworks have never been better.
We just came home yesterday and for us, the magic is definitely still going strong. Sure we spent a lot on tickets and genie+ and ILL, but since rides and general ambiance were our priorities, we went cheap on food and drinks and souvenirs. (QS, groceries for breakfast, sharing snacks.) Balance is the name of the game.
I‚Äôve been numerous times last year and this year. It‚Äôs not a bad time. Things have changed, obviously, but it‚Äôs what you make it ya know? You and your family will have a great time I‚Äôm sure. üòä
Same. I am worried too! Going at the end of June for the first time in 12 years!
I wouldn't worry too much. I think the main issue is with unrealistic expectations.
I went in May and had a great time despite the changes! The magic was still there for me and plenty of people in this sub. 
This, plus change is hard
Sorry I didn‚Äôt know they were common.
The solution is to not go. If you don‚Äôt enjoy it anymore, go somewhere else. Not as punishment to Disney, but because you don‚Äôt like it and want to try something new.
They could simply let less people into the park and accept lower profits. Maybe pay and treat the staff better? Disney has gotten greedy imo.
Both my kids wanted to leave early and felt the rides were dated. We travel to a fair amount of amusement parks so they know what‚Äôs available. I didn‚Äôt mention any of the costs to them so that didn‚Äôt factor into their enjoyment. I convinced them to stay for the fireworks because it‚Äôs always a highlight.
Agreed! The expectations grown people put on Disney is a little ridiculous. They want the old Disney Magic with fresh experiences that never change the existing attractions. In a sea of thousands of people, they want to feel special. The prices need to increase to keep some people out (and make it a "once-in-a-lifetime" experience again), but we don't want to be the ones to pay that fee. I don't know how anything can make this bar.
Care to elaborate?
When was fall break for you? Were crowds horrible, like spring break level, then also?
Works for us too.  It‚Äôs a great deal for offsite guests especially.
The two are not parallel at all.
Poorly implemented, requires too much customer time and interaction, average guest only uses it 2 to 3 times a day, and $30 per ticket more is too much for what you receive. I  prefer the way roller coaster parks implement fast passes.
The cost is somewhat meaningless to me, but I still do appreciate some value. My main issue is the lack of magic. They really need to solve the staff morale problems. It‚Äôs hard to be magical when the staff couldn‚Äôt care less about their work.
wake up - always has been
It can be both in Fantasyland
Disney has lots of competition now for our entertainment dollars. We will simple go elsewhere. I don‚Äôt see Disney changing in any meaningful way. There is almost no motivation for them if the guests keep packing in. Shareholder value rarely cares about the long game.
I‚Äôve watched the video and it doesn‚Äôt say that.
Walt Disney can definitely deliver a better experience, reduce customer costs, and still make a healthy profit.
I could tell by how the food came out. For one it came from the kitchen faster than it could be cooked. Two, the gravy around my steak had congealed. My daughters salad came out with the dressing below the lettuce. It was exactly the type of food you would get a large catered event like a wedding.
Wdw may not be as busy as it was precovid, but it‚Äôs whine-ier.  Lots of angry technophobic legacy fans.  Then they exaggerate anecdotes to make their point.
Yes but those were new and they were the only rides that long. Now it seems every ride is an hour or two wait unless you buy the extra passes/service. You could easily choose to skip those rides and come back in a year or two when the newness wore off and not miss the rest of your vacation.
I will admit that I liked the atmosphere at SC, and our server Ally was great.... but the food and drinks was something worth $50ish.... not $100 for 2 people.
Gene only answers to one guy: Gene
Ahhhh! Gene!
All you have to do is type in ‚Äúcon man Albuquerque.‚Äù
Unfortunately, I think it‚Äôs systemic. Better pay, yes, but work morale is universally bad in the service industry. It‚Äôs the zeitgeist of it, a culture of dissatisfaction (for good reason in many cases) that just disengages workers. 
I love DW for the simplicity and safety. I have 4 kids, most are out of the house now, but I‚Äôve never had an easier and better family vacation than Disney. 
I agree with you.
I don‚Äôt think you understood my post. 
There are also months where the locals don‚Äôt come out in force. Late fall, right after spring break, just some times when you‚Äôre not seeing that absurd level of activity.
Days children aren‚Äôt out of school.
I agree with you, but it‚Äôs not an issue of losing good Cast Members. It‚Äôs an issue of the company culture shift at Disney. A good company culture can teach anyone how to be a ‚ÄúDisney CM‚Äù but a bad company culture, like the one that‚Äôs been developing for the past 9 or so years, equates to what we see today. And it‚Äôs only heightened by the recent pandemic. There is a lot more rude CMs these days than there‚Äôs ever been in the past.
It's not THAT hard to change. It just costs a little bit of that thing that we all spend a whole lot of every time we visit. Money. Keep your employees happy, meaning well paid, benefits (not just health either), and support them. You'll be surprised what happens when people are happy with where they work.
My main current issue with the prices going up is that they are charging more despite not paying CMs and providing a worse guest experience
Corporations are enjoying record profits. They could easily pay more,  but it would mean smaller bonuses/paychecks for the people at the top. Lord knows that will never happen.
[deleted]
OH THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY CAN‚ÄôT PAY A LIVING WAGE? Then who can? Who literally could? At that point why have a society??
Look into how much Disney's board of executives make (and the fact that their failed CEO was given a $20 million payout). Disney can absolutely afford to pay its employees more, like virtually every other corporation in this profit-driven country, but they choose not to because it might cut into their cushy lives.
I would advocate for higher wages AND higher ticket prices. As a shareholder (only a few hundred shares so nothing special) and as a regular guest, I wanna see lower crowds, higher stock prices, and happier employees.
If anyone wants to pay me to go, ill go
The Orlando airport just had its busiest day ever.
I‚Äôm with you here. I find the ‚Äúbut you went at a busy time‚Äù comments very unhelpful. Disney is always busy compared to almost anything else, even during their ‚Äúoff peak‚Äù seasons. It‚Äôs not unreasonable to expect good food, good service, and an enjoyable holiday during a peak season. You are paying for that privilege! You are correct to expect better.
Yeah I have to say that‚Äôs honestly rotten luck and I‚Äôm sorry that happened! We were there the week after Labor Day and everything was so chill and we had a wonderful time. 
We went in October and it was wonderful. We did pay for all the extras and that was a little eye opening with costs but the only rides we had to wait longer than 30 minutes for were ones that had maintenance issues and broken down. 
We go every yr during Christmas also because my wife is also a teacher.  After this last trip we decided to now only go every other year. The price increases are just lil to much.  An also the kids r a lil older now and have been there 10 times now but!! This yr instead of spending 8,000$ at disney we decided to just go on 2 beach vacations and 1 cedar point trip and we still save about 2grand. Sad cuz we love love love Disney but
Tell me more about March break?
A lot of my old team at Disney went to Uni. There‚Äôs still a lot left to accomplish over the next few years too! Very tempting.
During covid, Disney stopped all projects because they didn't have proper income. Their current problem is that they need to refurbish rides and make marked infrastructure changes, but their parks are too busy, and again, they have that anti work mindset if they don't see profits. 
Universal will be their motivation. Once their new theme park opens its going to create some serious competition.
Shulas is fantastic. Give Todd English Bluezoo a try if you get a chance. Outstanding seafood and service. 
Yep!
Animal Kingdom Lodge is the best place I‚Äôve ever stayed. Spent my honeymoon there in one of the safari facing villas and nothing beats drinking a cup of coffee early in the morning while a family of giraffes eats 20 feet away.
gotta watch a few tutorials on youtube and you'll get it immediately. we did 13 rides 10 of which were genie+ from 9:30am-9pm.
I‚Äôm glad you had a nice time and these complaints do not take away from it ‚Äì but I don‚Äôt want to play a game of analysis and strategy and optimization that costs me money. It‚Äôs a day at Disney World. Why are they asking me to make appointments and do scheduling work for them? Why do I pay to do that?
Ahh, well I wouldn‚Äôt have thought that was a steal then. That‚Äôs too bad, it was $15 when I was there a month ago.
That‚Äôs fair. I only had to pay for myself and was only at the parks one day, so for me, I was happy to pay to maximize my time. I got to see three parks in one day instead of paying for two days of parks, and saved money overall for that. Didn‚Äôt realize it used to be free though, so could understand that being frustrating now. Were the lightning lines as efficient then though compared to now?
Bet all of the good CMs have left‚Ä¶seen this too many times at corporate, those who actually care are treated like replaceable crap until they leave, and it‚Äôs just never the same after‚Ä¶but upper level management has their heads in their you know what!
It would only be an issue for people that don't like planning ahead. And honestly, people that are willing to put in the time and effort to plan out their Disney trips months out deserve to have a better experience in return, even if it comes at the cost of people whose typical Disney visit is often done on a whim.
It's the only way to get reservations and it's terrible.  I'm sorry you don't see the connection.
Yes you can, it‚Äôs called being a legacy wdw fan!
Me every single time I go to Costco ü§£
"Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded."
And they still build rides and restaurants.
Expansion costs money and brings more people helping neither the cost nor the crowd complaints. If you want Disney to both lower prices while also capping tickets they can't afford expansion.
They just opened a huge e-ticket ride and a much anticipated restaurant in the past week.
and Mad TV
Crazy that he and pops are still alive but norm and Bob are gone
We stayed 3 nights at Universal but we stayed offsite for Disney so this is a little like comparing cheeseburgers to apples but bear with me.   
Agree on the phone. What did you feel was nickel and dimed?
It‚Äôs a phone world after all
Hmmm I checked ticket prices and they weren‚Äôt significantly more. I‚Äôm assuming your referring to all other expenses?
Back
Sure they could. But is that how or form of business works? Which other company voluntarily cuts their customer base and lowers prices at the same time?
Then your kids are part of the minority. And if they‚Äôre wanting to leave because the rides are outdated y‚Äôall didn‚Äôt ride any of the new age stuff. Flight of Passage, RotR, Guardians‚Ä¶ those are all state of the art rides with nothing else in the world really comparing
Agreed.
Oct 5th was the day in question. We had just left Universal Hollywood and decided to hit one day at Disneyland on the way to San Diego. Genie was useless that day. Everything sold out very quickly so we were stuck in the cycle of only getting to book things every 2 hrs. 4 rides were all we managed using Genie that day. Here‚Äôs a pic of rope drop on the Frontierland rope alone. https://i.imgur.com/kHJx9rw.jpg
How is it not? Inflation is inflation. I went to MNSSH in 2019 for $75 now it‚Äôs like $125 this past year.
It literally is exactly the same as fastpass was just with a small cost. So wasn't anything to implement except change the name and add the cost. 
I went for the first time in ~20 years at the end of January. This was very apparent to me. I still had a great time but you couldn't help but feel like you were a burden to many cast members. Over worked and under paid would be my guess. I don't hold it against them as I'm sure it is tough to deal with tourists every single day but that doesn't change how I felt. As a Disneyland regular, I'm glad it's not like that here. I knew the trip would be expensive so I don't have any complaints there. The difference in cast member friendliness was very jarring to me.
Agreed.
7DMT was opened in 2014 and FOP was in 2017, so that logic doesn‚Äôt work-
True. For Gene. but how about Gene+?
This guy gets it - ur absolutely right. This is largely a psychosomatic response to the pandemic. Basically everyone is walking around in society singing ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt get no satisfaction‚Äù all day. This will correct itself someday, I hope. Being in the service industry was a point of pride for many, I worry it might not ever be again though. Which means we as a country are doomed, as we are a service economy.
[deleted]
Agreed. Lot of bored looking and inconsiderate CMs these days. Was here a few years ago, and it was much better all around.
Not related to your comment but‚Ä¶ RobPlays? You gonna release any new videos soon?
I dont think they have EVER paid a good wage. I know when my aunt and uncle moved to florida a LOOOOOOONG time ago (the 90s) my uncle made a lot more than my aunt. He worked at Universal her and Disney. HE was there until his passing a few years ago.. she left Disney pretty quickly. And she's a HUGE disney fan to this day.
I‚Äôll give you a dollar to go.
MCO experience deteriorating.
People are making up for missed vacations. It's been wild.
As another teacher...we only get peak times off. Peak times are when school is out.
Support more positive thinking like this.
When in October did you go? We are headed there during the 3rd full week of October because it coincides w/ my husband's work conference.  I'm really hoping that 1-1.5 weeks before Halloween it will also be fairly chill? * pretty please *
Y'all are allowed to use more than 2 vacation days in a row without a doctor's note?
I was there from October 4-12 and it was horrible compared to what it used to be. Like OP said, the staff was miserable, the food sucked and the amount of people was gross. Not to mention they upped the price of genie + half way through. It‚Äôs simply not what it used to be and Im not confident that it will get any better
I'm married to a teacher and have multiple teacher relatives in various districts. None of them get vacation days other than when school is out.
Not all projects were stopped btw. Still a lot of coned projects still went full steam ahead.
Looking at them as I type this!
Ear Scouts? ;) (Rob has a true talent for turning the potential frustrations of Genie+ into a game, and I love it! Can't wait to try my hand at the Genie Slots!)
Then don‚Äôt do it‚Ä¶it‚Äôs completely optional.
Lower attendance caps and higher prices. You sure are saying a lot of things I‚Äôll give you that.
G+ has nothing to do with dining reservations, it‚Äôs a separate system, sorry you didn‚Äôt know
This guy Yogi Berras.
The very first thing was paying for parking in 80% empty lots.  Fortunately, that‚Äôs recently been eliminated.
Total cost is up. You‚Äôll have to buy genie+ which adds $30 to the ticket. Parking has doubled, food costs up and quality way down, additional experiences costs are way up,  merchandise is up, I figure each day in the park is around $1000 conservatively. We probably spent closer to $1500 a day for a family of four. This is without hotel costs as we have a condo near by.
I shall! I am looking forward to it!
A good company that values long term sustainability over short term profits. Pure capitalism is a virus to the people and planet. We should not consider this acceptable.
I would never openly complain to my kids or even show the reduced enjoyment. It‚Äôs quite the opposite. The most fun I get now it watching my kids enjoy life.
yikes! thank you for sharing. we were considering an october trip but heard some of the crowds could be awful due to fall breaks. i assumed most fall breaks lined up with Columbus Day
That rope drop is INSANE.
This picture belongs in the nope subreddit.
$30 or $370, it‚Äôs a bullshit cash grab at either price.
So you are saying in early 2020 the wait for those rides was still 4 hours? I assumed when you said pre-pandemic you meant when they opened. I didn‚Äôt know you meant literally March 12, 2020
isn't that just an overweight version of Gene?
At my church they out a plus after the name to show they are an ordained priest. So gene+ is know as Father Gene or Rev Gene.
Gene+ is Gene Simmons bitching about why it‚Äôs not his face on the app.
Totally agree. Disney doesn‚Äôt put any effort into their people anymore. That‚Äôs why I left my role at Creative.
[deleted]
They paid a living one.
Testify! That airport is terrible.
Is that even possible?
Won't hear Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer talking about that on the APMs.
At first, but is that still the case?   I think all the people moving to Florida are buying annual passes and the locals are making it unbearable for the people who save for their once every 5-10 year trips.
I realize that. My stepmom has been a teacher for nearly 20 years now. OP said they always do spring break and Christmas, there are other breaks times they could go even that aren‚Äôt quite as crazy as those two.
First week the 3rd thru the 9th I think?  It was also no weekend.
Absolutely. They are our vacation days not sick days.
That sucks. We get 3 each year and can carry 2 over for a total of 5. I also think I‚Äôve accrued 150 sick days in 10 years.
yes!!!
HAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHA
Nice contribution to the discussion - downvoting people you disagree with and giving sarcastic replies with no counterargument. Great job.
$1500 A DAY FOR A FAMILY OF 4?? Based on tickets, G+, parking, food and merch but not hotel?? That seems outrageous.
So again, name a company that does that. Who is the model? Which public company does these things and doesn‚Äôt take a beating on its profits and earnings? This company is hemorrhaging money for different reasons. Yet everyone wants them to voluntarily bring in less with no real ROI on that decision. 
I didn‚Äôt say openly complain. But kids can tell. You may not recognize it but they pick it up.
It‚Äôs mostly AZ fall breaks that increase the crowds ( I‚Äôm from AZ). Our school district gets 2 weeks for spring, fall and winter breaks
Yeah was definitely nuts. We stayed at Grand Californian so I was able to be the first in line at the gates that day. Helped a little. Walked onto Thunder Mountain, and that was it. Everything turned to immediate 60 min waits
Worst Disney day we‚Äôve ever had. So I‚Äôm gonna agree with you 100%. Lol
Welcome to every theme park in the entire world.
Except one is 10x more than the other, equating the two makes no sense
No that‚Äôs the actualized version of Gene since Laura left him.
No, Gene+ is Gene after 6 months doing crossfit.
Great to hear! Looking forward to it.
whats your definition of a living one? i doubt that.
Being a local I actually do not mind it. Lol. Precheck is the way.
Yes. Still. Think about it. It is always busy around this time a year, so you have that plus people who put off their disney trips for a couple of years. People are rescheduling them sporadically, and I think we will continue to see that for at least the rest of the year. But you're right, I'm sure the flood of people moving to Florida has contributed as well. I don't think it is any one thing. A lot of different things are coming together for the perfect storm. Regardless. It's crazy.
Annual passed haven‚Äôt been for sale in over a year so no not really
Thanks! Yea, I imagine sticking to weekdays is also a good idea, if it can be helped!
Lucky! We get 5 personal days (and we get sick days) but you can only use one at a time. If you have special circumstances you can plead your case but vacation would not win their favor.
Mine are the same thing. We get 12 and can't use more than two in a row without a doctor's note and can't use them directly before or after a long weekend or break.
They get sick days but are subject to enhanced interrogation techniques if they try to use them.
They're awesome!!! I don't feel overwhelmed at all anymore planning our honeymoon. All thanks to Rob and Eric!
Okay I‚Äôm having a little fun with this but your position isn‚Äôt popular! Most folks want more capacity and lower prices and also for no one else to be in line for Mine Train. We aren‚Äôt a logical bunch.  
That comes out to about $190.75/day for each person for food and merchandise so they‚Äôre either buying a ton of merch, eating every meal at a top restaurant or buffet, or way over estimating how much they‚Äôre actually spending.
Agree.  My dad and I went for 3 days in September.  Our total for food, admissions, merch, AND hotel was about 400 each per day.  That‚Äôs at AK lodge with genie+ and eating whatever we want.  Was about 160 for admissions and genie +, 80 each for food and stuff, and the rest hotel.
Total cost is up. You‚Äôll have to buy genie+ which adds $30 to the ticket. Parking has doubled, food costs up and quality way down, additional experiences costs are way up,  merchandise is up, I figure each day in the park is around $1000 conservatively. We probably spent closer to $1500 a day for a family of four. This is without hotel costs as we have a condo near by.
There are many companies that have values and still make solid profits. Costco comes to mind as a obvious one that is very successful.
Costco
This is how legacy wdw fans think.  They had their way of touring back in the day, it doesn‚Äôt work the same way anymore, and they think the solution is for Disney to cut prices and sell fewer tickets.
oh wow!! thank you. that information helps a lot planning wise.
That‚Äôs the thing:  Disney had set their parks apart from other theme parks.  Not anymore.
But does he talk about it nonstop 24/7 even after everyone has asked him to stop and told him they don't care?
I live up near DC. I just had a coworker have to go through MCO I made sure to give him the appointment link. He said it worked great. There were no appointments last time I was down.
For me it‚Äôs not security. It‚Äôs the weather. Storms all the time and there already always delays. Last time I flew there my plane had a mechanical issue that delayed 2 hours (I had to deplane) then a storm rolled in that delayed 2 hours. It was a nightmare day. Also turns out‚Ä¶I caught COVID the day before and didn‚Äôt know (just felt tired and run down) which didn‚Äôt help.
I flew out of there last week and the people directing people to lines directed me to the non pre check lines and said ‚Äúthey‚Äôre opening another precheck lane‚Äù so I stood in that and it turns out that was a total lie and i had to take off my shoes AND ended up getting a pat down. 0/10 would not recommend that
We get 2 personal days and 10 sick days. (3+ days in a row needs a note.) I wish we got more personal days.
You need a doctors note for a personal day
yea just follow their advice. it was my first time using genie plus. our group split into two.. me my husband and our two kids where I controlled the genie plus for us all. we did split up once or twice bu tusually went on all the same rides. our other group of 4 adults went separate from us.. they did like 3 genie plus rides all day. like i said above we got around 10 maybe 11. it pays to study. lol
also make sure you get up early and set your alarm to get that first ride you want that sells out. for us it was peter pan. we got it for 9am.
I don't think the situation is dire. And furthermore, if people don't like how it is then there is nothing forcing them to go. But I did agree with OP that lowering the attendance cap would make it more enjoyable.
Lol at values. Have a nice day.
Still do,  it's the cheapest express around. Their food prices are actually quite reasonable. Merch is on par.
It is included in his full name and any sentence that comes out of his mouth, starting with ‚ÄúHello, I am Gene+ Cross Fit‚Ä¶‚Äù
Will do! Thanks for all of the advice! I'm an early riser anyway (peri-meno insomnia beginning, so I'm usually up around midnight for an hour or so everyday...)
Yes I‚Äôm local AP. I don‚Äôt mind the caps And any concern about that is mostly gone with the new rules where I can go after 2 PM any day. But I also don‚Äôt mind crowds because any given day for us is never do or die. Soarin is a zoo? Maybe next time. 
I‚Äôm glad I don‚Äôt live in your cynical world. Why get up everyday if not to treat those around you with respect. American style capitalism is a disease in which you believe more stuff equal more happiness.
buying genie plus is at 12am i think the first ride booking starts at 7am. double check tho! things change all the time.
I get that. A lot more is at stake for people flying in for their once-a-year/decade/lifetime trip. The crowds are definitely not as enjoyable of an experience for that type of guest as they may be for you.
Or you can adapt and solve your own problems.
Oh, I know! Rob taught me everything! Hahaha! I'll be awake regardless.
