Actually insane how Riot manages to keep this game relevant over 10 years after its release.

It's a bit wild how popular LoL is in China. I was reading my Chinese feed (almost entirely unrelated to gaming) and people were freaking out about this.
Look up the EDG worlds win Chinese celebration in Youtube and it's the biggest thing I've ever seen in esports
I remember when Chinese viewership numbers were posted many years ago and Reddit refused to believe they were legitimate for many years, buying into the stereotype that China fakes numbers. Turns out they weren't fake. Video games are insanely popular there.
It is true, the numbers that are shown are arbitrary.  But Riot will always release the official numbers a bit later
Faker is STILL playing? I stopped following competitive League like 4-5 years ago, and already then there was talk of him retiring...
He just won his 4th championship, 10 years after winning the first one. He's basically cemented his legacy as the undisputed greatest
Back in my day he had already secured his legacy 😂
Split faker's career into two and he just takes the #1 and #2 goat spots, that's how insane it is.
I remember before he was really known and not even a pro player when his Leblanc gameplay videos were being posted and for the time was absolutely unreal gameplay. That was I think more than 11 years ago.
Now the meta has changed, nowadays he mostly mind control his teammates into playing like absolute best.
earlier this year when he had wrist injuries (maybe he was sick, I forget the actual issue), he had to stop playing for a few weeks and his team went 1-7 almost not qualifying for Worlds entirely.
Jeez, must be demoralizing to realize that youre practically being carried by one person on your team and are pretty much lost without him.
His teammates are arguably better at the game on a mechanical level when it comes to overall gameplay. He just brings a lot of experience, shotcalling, leadership, and can make his teammates shine bright.
he only hopped into a ranked queue cause his norms were taking too long and so he started getting noticed.
The Wayne Gretzky of e-sports
That’s just how GOATs are, Tom Brady, Lebron, Kobe Bryant, MJ, all had two HoF careers
HoF and goat is really far apart though. Also LeBron has like 3 HoF careers at this point, which is insane.
That's what he means. Faker was already the best back in the day, but while in other sports/esports other players might rise and become
the best, Faker has NEVER faltered and lost that title. He's STILL the best and there's never been a question and at this point, winning another worlds, it's cemented he's the best and until he retires there likely won't be someone better.
He looked better than ever this year. When he was out with an injured wrist, his team looked utterly amateurish, in danger of missing the tournament altogether. And then this run to the finals where T1 just plain danced around their opponents. 11-1 against the LPL. JDG the super team managed to win one game. LNG, the number two, got only one objective all series - a single herald that didn’t even manage to tackle a tower.
Yeah his time away showed Faker is the most valuable player in the world.  It's insane how the rest of them forgot how to play when Faker isn't there
Because he’s the absolute shot caller and play maker. You ever see him check his lanes?  It looks like his screen is glitching out.
What is this revisionist history? This is the best he's looked in a WHILE. Definitely the 🐐 but he wasn't the best mid in the LCK let alone the world for his whole career. Plenty of dips in form. Which is fine, he's outlasting everyone else and his peaks were dominant af.
he's pretty constant at least top 5 world some years he is top 3, some top 5 but never gets below that, and in this year I think it was pretty clear he was the best
I don't even play or watch League and I know that name, all I know is the dude's crazy.
He's been the best for longer than quite a few other pros' entire careers lasted.
I love the ozymandias reference but the irony of using it in this thread given the meaning of the poem is pretty funny.
the ceaseless sands of time come for us all in the end
He’s never played me.
Of course not, he’s not Silver.
True. He's at least gold since we know he lost to a gold brand.
Isn't he still in like literally every single Worlds trailer that they make each year? I vaguely recall the last one even having the song break down with the word "god" with Faker doing a fucking superhero landing on beat.
I didn't even care about Worlds until I saw the Faker Ruler fight with all the history behind it.
Well for a while there was some talk but recently he won the League event for the Asian games which basically gives him an exemption form Military Service because of an Athlete exemption rule. and then he just won the World championships for the 4th time. 
He's STILL WINNING and honestly he was the best he looked since 2017, best mid this worlds.
Respect APA?
No joke he had one of the better showings against Faker of the whole tournament.
And then he got fucken creamed by Palafox lmao.  The NA boys did pretty good this worlds
Show some respect to Nisqy.
Nah, you can't be overlooking Palafaker
He's insane. Even if you cut his achievements in half he's still the best performing player of all time
Korean wayne Gretzky
Honestly he gives me hope for esports alone. Most franchises can’t survive off 2-3 years of success or a player with a 5 year career. Faker is proving that age is far less of a factor in gaming than I think almost anyone thought.
Age never really mattered, it's moreso just moving on with your life and not being able to commit 10-12 hours a day, 6 days a week working. 
I don’t think there was literally any basis in gaming for players with long careers is the main thing I’m saying. Some that went from BW to WoL but no one has been literally top of the global charts for a game for 10+ years. It IS both a testament to the game staying relevant, but more to the player IMO
Fighting game players have long careers. Guys like Tokido, Daigo, and Fuudo are in their late 30s/early 40s and still strong. Fuudo's 38 and probably the strongest SF6 player in Japan atm.
Fighting games are mostly a mental game, at least at the top levels.  They are incredibly skilled players, but reflexes matter less and so aging is less detrimental.
The Unkillable Demon King >>>>>>>>
Man this brings back so many memories, I still remember when this nick name was new in S3 world, his first international tournament and he already cement himself as a Goat, and he still is 10 years later, his consistency is absolutely bonkers.
I saw his name on the best esports player for the fame awards and knew his name.   Which means he’s been around, because I care for esports about as much as Blizzard does(stopped following in 2012)
He smurfed the fuck out of game 3 and completely owned in the quarter and semi finals
yeah, it's wild.  so much has happened in my life and i comeback end of the year every year.  sad to see so many older players move on, but Faker still going is so fun.
Probably decided to not retire after finding out that winning gold at the asian olympics can get him out of mandatory military service
I would not have stayed up for anybody else but Faker
He is co-owner of T1 Entertainment and Sports, "generous contract" is putting it mildly.
His monthly spend is about 200$, he refuse to trash talk his opponents, refuses to give thumbs down 👎 when asked by photographer, the most Humble GOAT of all time, i am goona cry when he retires😭😭.
I was just in South Korea and he's all over advertisements for Samsung and other Korean companies. Mans's got the bag ten times over.
Funny thing is he never gonna spend all that money, mf is living in 200$ budget
It's interesting because a lot of Asian league players come from lower class backgrounds and humble upbringings.  It's pretty much the opposite for the Westerm players
He owns 9 story building in Seoul, is part owner of T1, had $20mil/year offers from China (or even blank cheque), yet he is still the same humble person as 10 years ago.
He also got his family jobs at T1 too.
we must thank daddy faker for letting us go to sleep early
we had a watch party at my house, was a disappointing series overall, but the experience of watching it with friends live was awesome
disappointing series overall
Classic TheShy experience. His BLG series was probably one of his best international showing only to follow up with whatever this mess is
It's so insane how T1 can take a single mistake like that and blow the whole game open on the back of it that quickly. The shy dying there with that stacked wave let Zeus put his foot on the gas and never took it off.
I didn't even care about Worlds until I saw the Faker Ruler fight with all the history behind it. Hypest eSports moment since Evo moment 37.
Same. I thought LoL would have died down by now vs back in it's heyday. Little do I know, still shattering records lol
I don't even really play the main game anymore, but I randomly started playing TFT and LoR after watching a match of this tournament, and I've been super impressed with the world and games they've created. Everything is clean, bug-free, and just feels and looks good.
I started playing 14 years ago in college because it was free so everyone could play.
I haven't watched in two years. But faker being one of, if not the best LoL player for almost a decade running is insane
Very glad that article is giving me a video ad updating me on the drama between MrBeast and Jack SepticEye.
OOTL what drama. Isnt jack mellow
A little depressed that I know this but Jack criticized Mr Beast for his style of content ruining YouTube, which didn’t mention YouTube’s own push towards corporatization and over-romanticized the platform’s past.
I don't know how strongly he criticized it, but I could imagine it being more frustration with the landscape as a whole and less that the person who started it makes videos as they do. It's not like MrBeast expected such a result, but also it's easy to go "If you just hadn't bothered we wouldn't be in this mess!", though there's obviously no putting the genie back in the bottle on that one. Less anger at the individual and more frustration at the helplessness of the situation, so wanting something to blame tends to follow.
I could imagine it being more frustration with the landscape as a whole
Damn, I remember that, thought it was ages ago.
Youtubes past should be MORE over-romanitcized. The moment people started to get paid for uploading movies, hoppies and passion turned into content and side hussles.
The alternative is YouTube makes shit loads of money for Google and creators get nothing. I get what you're saying, but this was always going to happen to the platform.
MB's videos really are crazy ADD feeling. They're like super intense, high concept reality TV or something.
Regardless of what his content is like, Mr Beast collaborates with some vile content creators who don't deserve such legitimacy. Seeing that sent me from apathetic of his existence to disliking him.
They're multimillionaires that made money through views. There is no drama except what they've agreed to manufacture.
Sometimes I figure it's more of an informal agreement. Like you say something, the other guy realizes he can act offended for views, and you stoke the flames for more views. Basically neither ever have an actual conversation about it but go to sleep thinking "honestly I don't give a fuck about this but hey it's cash"
That's just the difference between an explicit and an implicit conspiracy.
If only more people realized this about 99% of online drama.
No wonder when it's T1 and Faker. The most iconic team and the most iconic player, now immortalised as the best ever. Might even be the best the game will ever see, at least relative to their time. 
I dont know anything about Esports but I am a big basketball fan and can say for certain the NBA performs at its best when superstars lead successful teams or “dynasties”. 
He has so many iconic moments and lines from casters, he won a 1v1 10 years ago where the caster went “FAKER WHAT WAS THAT” and nowadays if anyone makes a cool play or you wanna be sarcastic and make fun of someone you just go “NAME WHAT WAS THAT”

Yeah back in the day if the series went 1-1, the final game was blind pick for some reason, huge meme.
Weibo looked like monsters coming into the finals, unfortunately the casters were right with the statement "Weibo clutches victory from the jaws of defeat, and those jaws also belong to Weibo"
Did they though? They didn't really face many strong teams on their way to the finals. Gen G was taken out in a narrow victory from BLG. Don't really need to say anything of NRG. BLG and WBG were competing for who could throw their game the hardest. People were talking about a blue side meta, and that's the only way that JDG took a game off of T1. But T1 smashed WBG three consecutive games with red side. I think WBG were incredibly lucky to make it into the finals, both in which opponents they met and the form their opponents were in during their matches. 
Crisp is a superb renata player...and then they gave it to the opponent
I'll admit that I haven't seen all of the matches, but from what I did see they were real scrappy and at points almost lost until their opponents blundered hard. either in draft or in game
Last year, I cared about getting good games and hoped for 5 games. The monkey paw curled and gave me 5 games, but Faker lost. This year, I said fuck that and decided to be content with a stomp if Faker won, I got what I wanted, God bless.
Not only a stomp, but also game with Faker Ahri and games with Oner Lee Sin so they can get their skins.
So happy to get an Ahri skin hopefully. Or fuck it another Azir skin.
The last Azir skin wasn't even his. Kind of think he should get an Unkillable Demon King Azir for the fans and an Ahri skin for himself. As the most legendary player ever he deserves it. Or maybe they'd reserve the Azir skin for when he retires.
A skin doesn’t cut it. They should give him a champ when he retires.
at minimun an item
Faker's gonna buy two more towers just with the T1 Ahri skin money.
They get a share of the skins they sell, ahri is ten times more popular than azir, money wise picking ahri for the skin is making millions more dollars
Faker wanted an Ahri skin since Season 3, and Faker being the person he is, he definitely doesn't care about the money he'll make off the skin.
i think i remember that faker picked ahri back then specifically because of that exact reason lol. i could be completely wrong though.
No, you're right. Back then, since his 1v1 Zed mirror match outplay vs Ryu was so famous, Riot wanted him to have a Zed skin instead since also Ahri was about to get a skin anyway (Popstar). There was also a rule that in order to get a world skin for a champ, you have to play that champ during that tourney., which is why he got Syndra and Ryze for the other wins.
The last Azir skin wasn't even his. Kind of think he should get an Unkillable Demon King Azir for the fans and an Ahri skin for himself. As the most legendary player ever he deserves it. Or maybe they'd reserve the Azir skin for when he retires.
Last year I was just happy that Deft finally got his victory, even though Faker had to lose for it to happen.
It may have been the first Worlds finals where a 3-0 stomp either way wouldn't have been an underwhelming outcome.
Damn. Me and my college friends were OBSESSED with LoL from 2010-2013. Stopped playing it after, didn’t realize it was STILL this popular. That’s really impressive and kinda makes me want to get back into it (but not really, it was toxic even in 2013 and I’ve heard it’s continued to get worse sadly…)
Don't get me wrong, it's still very toxic but there's been a lot of pushes to reduce the issues recently. Increased punishments, getting muted for the whole game if you set off filters, pings used for toxic reasons in the past get a longer cooldown if you're spamming them etc
Meh it's not that bad. As someone who has been playing for 10+ years and still play a few hours every day, I think it got better. Riot made a ton of changes to reduce toxicity. You can also report people directly during the game now and it mutes them automatically.
Also haven’t played in a few years. After watching worlds, played a few games recently, every game people were so toxic. Even if we were winning, like 20 kills ahead, I had a jungler afk because we missed a dragon kill. Reminded me why I quit, and stopped playing haha.
Even I tuned in after watching F1 race, and I haven't played league since SKT T1 won their third worlds. Good times.
F1 back to back into worlds was my highlight today! Las Vegas was great, T1 winning is greater!
Wait why did they run the vegas race starting at 1AM eastern? They catering to european viewership? Even then I'd think you could do like 10 AM local time, that's still only like 7PM in Europe
It would be kinda dumb for Vegas to not be a night race, don't you think?
Yeah but the sun sets at like 5pm now, you have a lot of options for when to start a night race.
You want to put Vegas traffic at a stand still during the busy day? Nah that is why they kept it so late at night
That and the lights of the strip
Has been a great event and viewership was saved by T1 being LPL slayers. What a story for T1 and Faker.
Meta became also surprisingly fresh after the Swiss stage
Meta became also surprisingly fresh after the Swiss stage
T1 decided that actually, their top laner can play whatever he wants, it doesn't matter what Faker plays, and Guma/Keria can stomp with any champions. 
I think Keria is legitimately the best player on the planet right now and has been for a couple years now, he's so absurdly good at whatever he picks
Keria on Bard was my favorite thing to watch this tournament. He pulled off some insane plays and carried some games with perfect ults and stuns.
Meta was mainly engage supports but T1 sort of created their own meta that everyone followed with ranged supports
And in this series they actually kind of brought Xayah and Rakan back after they made other teams switch off it.
To be fair, Guma and Keria could have played just about anything, the gap between WBG and T1 was that vast.
Sadly, it's only second fastest. Fastest is still IG vs Fnatic.
Aw, that would have been a nice stat
Zeus casually flame horizoning TheShy in G1.
26 seconds longer than FNC vs iG S8
IIRC it was the fastest finals ever
Xayah has like a 90% pick ban rate this tournament. They didn’t bring her back, they just simply out drafted their opponents.
It's mostly the Rakan, Xayah lost priority in semis but Rakan is still S tier. It was perma banned in most games before that
There were 3-4 really disgusting champs that seemed completely unbeatable, Xayah was tier 0 and was an auto win for her team, midlane played 2 champions, sup was engage only, toplane was 3 champions
Reminder that these numbers do not include viewership from China, where the vast majority of players/viewers come from.  
China viewership was probably insane. There was a Chinese team in every knockout game this year.
With Chinese viewers, T1 vs JDG had 30 million watchers.
For instance according to korean pc bang numbers LoL has been the #1 most played game there concurrently for over  5 years which they only lost pace to Overwatch 1 launch. Without it would have been almost a decade. Also Vietnam is like the top 3rd-4th region region with the most players according to Riot.
Europe is growing everyyear in League, you can see this on stats websites for ranked accounts. Only NA is dying and mostly because zoomers are just spamming Valorant, so Riot doesn't care at all
It's funny how year after year we'll get the classic "league is dying" post on the league subreddit, only for viewer and player metrics to tell a completely different story.
A lot of the “league is dying” talk is about specifically in NA though, and the performance by LCS at this Worlds only further cemented that
Yeah, the metrics for views on LCS see trending downwards, and are lower than they were a decade ago, despite the sport growing massively since then. Nobody's interested in watching a league with teams that can't compete on the international stage.
That isn’t true. The French league is massive despite its teams unable to compete in LEC or Worlds. I think it’s more about how can people connect with the teams and what stories are being told throughout the season.
Brazil too.
One of my pet theories is that the reason the eSports bubble kinda "popped" is just because NA is concurrently bad at LoL, CS, and Dota, and all the people throwing crazy money at it really needed this to not happen as we Americans spend a lot of money lol
One of my pet theories is that the reason the eSports bubble kinda "popped" is just because NA is concurrently bad at LoL, CS, and Dota
Gonna be interesting to see what happens with TL I guess. The trend of LCS outspending for Korean talent has been going on for a while now, and it's not really working.
Better ask what NRG was doing right, oh wait Steve doing another attempt at a Korean roster instead of developing a project that could shine in 2-3 years.
I legit can't believe TL went with a full KR speaking roster. The things they will do to try to "buy" wins, instead of developing domestic talent.
instead of developing domestic talent.
EG winning TI5 but then proceeding to be mid and 3rd place for the rest of the 2010s and its consequences were a disaster for NA dota
Our strength in esports isn't with mobas but we do pretty well in fighting games! I can actually have national pride for once in esports, we have a lot of insane players in the FGC here.
They literally fielded 3 rookies this year, what are you yapping about. NRG did well with already established players who were given a second chance, Dhokla, Contractz and Ignar were being called paycheck stealers until last split. TL tried to field rookies even though they were comfortably their worst players.
It's true for (association) football, it's true for LCS, it's true for CS. Sad thing since the US brings big money to everything it watches (which is something that e-sports need), but it is what it is.
The situation for football will be interesting to watch. Having Messi in the MLS might bring in new young fans that could help build the future of football in the US. I don't really see the same thing happening in League, outside of if Faker learns English and goes to the LCS.
The Apple TV deal will help MLS as well, imo. A lot of people want to watch some form of sport without having to juggle services just to watch their team, and Apple TV condenses things down to just one service. It's why I started watching MLS this year, at least. 
This year was NAs best showing in years.  Not really saying much, but still.
They did better than EU this year, though.
I doubt he watched Worlds and he's just talking out of his ass. If anything, EU  under-performed this year.
Yet, he is +251 at this time.
EU isn't a particularly high bar, especially this season.
NRG performed way above expectations and also humiliated EU with a team made up of homegrown talent instead of washed up overpaid imports. Not all doom and gloom for NA.
Did you watch this year's world's?
I wouldn't say viewer metrics can necessarily be used as an indicator for the game itself. I don't know how it is for League, but for Dota a lot of people that no longer play the game will still follow the Esport scene.
I struggle to get back into Dota and I still religiously watch TI every year. Both of these games are absolutely terrible at easing returning players back in
It absolutely pulls in more watchers than players these days. At least on the western side. Especially when it has big name pulls like Faker (or even that kpop group NewJeans which im sure some people tuned in just for)
The "Game X is dying" talk will only stop when Game X actually is dead.
I was going to skip it but a friend mentioned that faker was going to take on all of china... I had to watch.
As someone who doesn’t play or watch league, it’s absolutely insane to me that Riot has managed to maintain this game’s momentum for as long as they have! Seriously, what’s their secret?
Contrary to what the community may make you believe, seasonal changes and new champions help keep the game fresh after many, many years 
I also just don’t think the game gets enough credit. It’s extremely deep and tactical while still being flashy and skill expressive. 
The game is fun to watch and as there is action all over the map and I think their coverage and commentating really adds a ton of value.
It's a combination of quite a few things.
I didn't realize how good I was having it with league when it comes to balance, until I started playing overwatch.
or Imo any other competitive game, its actually crazy how blessed league is with riot
Faker is eSports most recognizable player. A national hero in Korea, and with how big LoL is in China, most likely a household name in all of China as well. He would be massive in the west as well if Riot didn't lose grip of Gen Z to Fortnite.
I haven't played league in like 5 years and follow zero e sports communities but I boot up the live stream just for the finals every year just to "FAKER, FAKER, FAKER" fan boy it up.
China as well. He would be massive in the west as well if Riot didn't lose grip of Gen Z to Fortnite.
League is about as big as cs in Europe.
Yep, haven't even heard about CS in a while on my country but I know full well some countries never left that hype train.
Its bigger.
Faker hard carries LOL esports imo, to have a 'goat' level guy that people really like is a huge thing for all types of sports, when you have a 'face' of a league, people will end up watching just for them, i don't even play league much and even i know who Faker is, and I'm sure a lot of people probably are in the same boat, barely play league or don't, but know him from something  
[deleted]
I hate this narrative that "WBG didn't deserve to be in the finals". Especially since you bring up the swiss stage, where T1 beat two NA teams and BLG to get through, not like they had to fight super hard. WBG did get stomped, but they had every right to be there.
yeah, but to get into finals, t1 had to beat fuckin JDG and LNG, while WBG beat only western teams and BLG. meanwhile KT had by far the hardest lineups throughout the whole tournament. it’s a byproduct of an overall better format, but we’re not exactly used to one fluke getting you to finals
Imo the format is almost perfect but needs two things;
I'm not convinced by the week-long gap between semis and finals, either. Teams need time to rest and prep, but it seems excessive. For better or worse, it seems like they prioritize weekend play times.
I think the weeklong gap is fine, it gives Riot time to build hype and gives the teams time to fully prepare, not to mention viewers don't have to worry about life getting in the way during the week, it works best for everyone.
WBG defeated BLG who defeated GenG
One upset from WBG lead to a 3-0 lame final. Honestly based on Summer Playoffs, if GENG didn't lose to BLG in a 5 game series they might have just beat T1 anyways.
T1 also stomped LNG and JDG. They just managed to scale up and have the best read of the meta.
I wouldn't call the JDG series a stomp, even ignoring a 3-1 scoreline two of JDG loses were close and even their win wasn't one sided. The real final atleast, though seeing Kanavi kinda run it down in game 4 felt like man was still playing for Team Korea
Monkeys paw curled alright, far more boring finals series this year but at least Faker got to take home at least one more title.
if headline is true, I think that's a strong argument that sports are really all about the star players that bring in the eye balls and that story lines and personalities do need to be developed
lets face it, most people tuned in for faker right? I had friends who were almost a decade removed from league tune in because faker.
I don't particularly love Lol, but forever grateful for the world building and lore Riot did for the universe, because we got the awesome Arcane and Legends Of Runeterra, and many great games and looking forward impatiently for the mmo!
Actually insane how Riot manages to keep this game relevant over 10 years after its release.

Why do so many watch league of legends tournaments? It can't just be all the players of the game that watch it right? What appeal does it have outside of the players?
Where do they get the numbers from? not doubting the massive popularity of this finals but just curious how accurate it is because there's so many places to watch it
This article says "Worlds 2023 viewership peaked at around 6.4 million outside of China". That's a lot of people! But in 2013 worlds 3 peaked at 8.5M. How is this "biggest ever"? I think later years were bigger too.
its always a win when actual skill based games like league and cs keep continuing to do well in the esports area
TIL it is a thing
I’ve never played lol, only seen bits and pieces of footage over the years and it’s just kind of shocking to me a game can go on so long and still be goin so strong
I thought the game was dying and eSports was dead?
I always resented Riot for throwing away everything I ever enjoyed about the game in order to do what I felt was effectively an endless campaign of pandering but my god was it absolutely the right call, business-wise.
watching league is like watching paint dry, but Faker has to be the best esports athlete ever at this point, right?
This is the yearly announcement that reminds me I'm totally disconnected from the online e-sports and streaming side of gaming. I haven't even heard of this tournament or any of the player names before and honestly don't care much about it. But on the other hand I have completed over 50 single player games this year and keep up to date with all releases.
Most watched esports but I haven't wanted to touch the game in over a year and will probably continue that streak.
That's surprising given how bad I felt riot did making it watchable. I didn't see a single notification or recommendation for any matches live or replays.
Insane, props to Riot, i have no idea how people find this snore fest, called pro-LoL, interesting or entertaining
Proof that even the most boring and poorly developed game can get massive viewership if you build the game around merchandising!
What was the purse for this one?
I know faker is famous, but it’s crazy that no one is talking about Zeus considering how he made Weibo and TheShy look like bronze players this series
Actually insane how Riot manages to keep this game relevant over 10 years after its release.
It's a bit wild how popular LoL is in China. I was reading my Chinese feed (almost entirely unrelated to gaming) and people were freaking out about this.
Faker is STILL playing? I stopped following competitive League like 4-5 years ago, and already then there was talk of him retiring...
I would not have stayed up for anybody else but Faker
we must thank daddy faker for letting us go to sleep early
we had a watch party at my house, was a disappointing series overall, but the experience of watching it with friends live was awesome
I didn't even care about Worlds until I saw the Faker Ruler fight with all the history behind it. Hypest eSports moment since Evo moment 37.
Same. I thought LoL would have died down by now vs back in it's heyday. Little do I know, still shattering records lol
I don't even really play the main game anymore, but I randomly started playing TFT and LoR after watching a match of this tournament, and I've been super impressed with the world and games they've created. Everything is clean, bug-free, and just feels and looks good.
I started playing 14 years ago in college because it was free so everyone could play.
I haven't watched in two years. But faker being one of, if not the best LoL player for almost a decade running is insane
i mean the game design is pretty iconic.. and the thing is they update the game every 2 weeks to make a new meta and change yearly some things... 
What's even more insane is how competitive DotA is still a thing after 18 years, half of that time it had no proper support.
[deleted]
Was going to say, I haven't heard anyone speak about LoL in ages surprised it's got such a following still.
I dislike how casino-fied the out-of-game game experience has become, but I guess that's not enough to deter people from the spectacle of watching matches.
Looking at some stats here, I'm surprised to see how low the prize pools are compared to the next MOBA on the list, Dota 2. Hell, their prize pools in general are pretty weak compared to other games that aren't even in the same genre. You'd think they'd be able to afford more considering the size of the player base.
It's wild Riot is keeping this game relevant after they got exposed for stealing that woman's breast milk and bullying her to death. Or was that Blizzard?
Phenomenal games? I don't enjoy watching riot jerk off faker for 3 hours than blow out 3 games in a 5 games series. Shit was rigged as fuck.
Really shows how hard overwatch bombed
Never played LoL but played dota 2 religiously from 2014 until like 2018 when I just grew tired of it, definitely impressed by this especially considering how much TI seems to be declining year after year.
I was gonna say ... people still play this?  I burned out like 6 years ago.
I wish I was interested in something that much, e-sports is just lik regular sports to me and I get bored fast, like 10 minutes before I'm falling asleep fast haha.
OOTL what drama. Isnt jack mellow
I dont know anything about Esports but I am a big basketball fan and can say for certain the NBA performs at its best when superstars lead successful teams or “dynasties”. 
Weibo looked like monsters coming into the finals, unfortunately the casters were right with the statement "Weibo clutches victory from the jaws of defeat, and those jaws also belong to Weibo"
That's the thing though, Weibo did start strong. They'd take little early victories, but Zeus and Oner just took over games and T1's map control was so high.
Not only a stomp, but also game with Faker Ahri and games with Oner Lee Sin so they can get their skins.
Last year I was just happy that Deft finally got his victory, even though Faker had to lose for it to happen.
It may have been the first Worlds finals where a 3-0 stomp either way wouldn't have been an underwhelming outcome.
Don't get me wrong, it's still very toxic but there's been a lot of pushes to reduce the issues recently. Increased punishments, getting muted for the whole game if you set off filters, pings used for toxic reasons in the past get a longer cooldown if you're spamming them etc
Meh it's not that bad. As someone who has been playing for 10+ years and still play a few hours every day, I think it got better. Riot made a ton of changes to reduce toxicity. You can also report people directly during the game now and it mutes them automatically.
Also haven’t played in a few years. After watching worlds, played a few games recently, every game people were so toxic. Even if we were winning, like 20 kills ahead, I had a jungler afk because we missed a dragon kill. Reminded me why I quit, and stopped playing haha.
[deleted]
Its MUCH bigger now. Every year more players, more viewers, more big vhanges to the game, more music videos and lore, more 3rd party games. More
Toxicity isn’t even the issue nowadays, the game just isn’t fun. With that said, there’s a 2v2v2v2 mode that’ll be rereleased soon, and that’s by far the most fun I’ve ever had playing LoL
F1 back to back into worlds was my highlight today! Las Vegas was great, T1 winning is greater!
Wait why did they run the vegas race starting at 1AM eastern? They catering to european viewership? Even then I'd think you could do like 10 AM local time, that's still only like 7PM in Europe
Meta became also surprisingly fresh after the Swiss stage
China viewership was probably insane. There was a Chinese team in every knockout game this year.
For instance according to korean pc bang numbers LoL has been the #1 most played game there concurrently for over  5 years which they only lost pace to Overwatch 1 launch. Without it would have been almost a decade. Also Vietnam is like the top 3rd-4th region region with the most players according to Riot.
Europe is growing everyyear in League, you can see this on stats websites for ranked accounts. Only NA is dying and mostly because zoomers are just spamming Valorant, so Riot doesn't care at all
A lot of the “league is dying” talk is about specifically in NA though, and the performance by LCS at this Worlds only further cemented that
I wouldn't say viewer metrics can necessarily be used as an indicator for the game itself. I don't know how it is for League, but for Dota a lot of people that no longer play the game will still follow the Esport scene.
The "Game X is dying" talk will only stop when Game X actually is dead.
Without T1 in the finals these numbers would have been way worse.
[deleted]
Depends on region - LoL is very strong in China and Korea, strong in NA, quickly dying in EU and in post-CIS its completely dead.
League can't die while we still need more seasons of Arcane.
Contrary to what the community may make you believe, seasonal changes and new champions help keep the game fresh after many, many years 
The game is fun to watch and as there is action all over the map and I think their coverage and commentating really adds a ton of value.
It's a combination of quite a few things.
The game is simply good. The lore is insane. The music videos and events are decent/good depending om how they land. The esports events are massive and Riot loses a LOT of money on those upfront (probably made up by the players over the year). 
The game very rarely gets stale.
It starts with the game itself.. actually respecting your player base and not treating them like money banks they can swindle.
I haven't played league in like 5 years and follow zero e sports communities but I boot up the live stream just for the finals every year just to "FAKER, FAKER, FAKER" fan boy it up.
China as well. He would be massive in the west as well if Riot didn't lose grip of Gen Z to Fortnite.
Also a shame that epic never bothered to try and make fortnite a proper esport
I hate this narrative that "WBG didn't deserve to be in the finals". Especially since you bring up the swiss stage, where T1 beat two NA teams and BLG to get through, not like they had to fight super hard. WBG did get stomped, but they had every right to be there.
Monkeys paw curled alright, far more boring finals series this year but at least Faker got to take home at least one more title.
The playerbase is way bigger than people watching the game tho.
[deleted]
League remains one of the world's most popular games. League's community is more than large enough to produce high viewership.
I haven't played dota in like, a year or two, but I still watch The International and all major tournaments, imagine it's exactly the same for league
Aggregation of different websites and costreams
Its many many more because the chinese numbers aren't included
https://escharts.com/tournaments/lol/2023-world-championship
they get it from riot lmao
The numbers for 2013 include China. The non-China peak for last year was 5.1M. Here are the numbers for all the events, although they only include China until 2015.
As opposed to?
You could make the argument that competitive League could be on the downturn in NA, but it is still wildly popular in China and South Korea
It is the better moba even if you dont agree with what they do.
How could you possibly compare skills across games?
Yatoro would like a word with you.
Flash and s1mple would like a word.
guess what there are people playing multiplayer games out there
Thanks for sharing! 👍👍👍
i have no idea how MILLIONS of people find this snore fest, called pro-LoL, interesting or entertaining
Bro league has to have literally the worst merchandising of any game lmao, what are you talking about.
As opposed to? It's a 14-year-old game at this point, it certainly has flaws, but to maintain its popularity, it most definitely can't be "boring" or "poorly developed". You a DOTA player by chance? lmao
Look up the EDG worlds win Chinese celebration in Youtube and it's the biggest thing I've ever seen in esports
I remember when Chinese viewership numbers were posted many years ago and Reddit refused to believe they were legitimate for many years, buying into the stereotype that China fakes numbers. Turns out they weren't fake. Video games are insanely popular there.
He just won his 4th championship, 10 years after winning the first one. He's basically cemented his legacy as the undisputed greatest
Well for a while there was some talk but recently he won the League event for the Asian games which basically gives him an exemption form Military Service because of an Athlete exemption rule. and then he just won the World championships for the 4th time. 
He's STILL WINNING and honestly he was the best he looked since 2017, best mid this worlds.
He's insane. Even if you cut his achievements in half he's still the best performing player of all time
Honestly he gives me hope for esports alone. Most franchises can’t survive off 2-3 years of success or a player with a 5 year career. Faker is proving that age is far less of a factor in gaming than I think almost anyone thought.
The Unkillable Demon King >>>>>>>>
I saw his name on the best esports player for the fame awards and knew his name.   Which means he’s been around, because I care for esports about as much as Blizzard does(stopped following in 2012)
He smurfed the fuck out of game 3 and completely owned in the quarter and semi finals
yeah, it's wild.  so much has happened in my life and i comeback end of the year every year.  sad to see so many older players move on, but Faker still going is so fun.
Probably decided to not retire after finding out that winning gold at the asian olympics can get him out of mandatory military service
He is co-owner of T1 Entertainment and Sports, "generous contract" is putting it mildly.
disappointing series overall
T1 vs JDG was the finals, WBG vs T1 was just a coronation.
The Worlds tournament is notorious for the best games being in semi-finals. The true finals are ALWAYS in semis. Remember this next year if you want to do any watch parties again. 
This is what commitment, constant balancing, fresh season changes, lore and cinematics do to your game. You get a good game.
it fell off in the west (mostly NA, stagnated in EU), but has exploded everywhere else, most notably china. NA has this weird obsession of quickly moving on with games, while other countries can play games for decades without getting bored.
Especially since most people hate playing the game
Dumbest shit I have ever heard.
LoL and DotA don't get as much attention these days but they're still doing as fine as ever. TI and Worlds were great.
If you mean in reddit/twitter, live service games dont get that much coverage here, people are vitriolic about GAAS games especially about riot since most of the subs here are valve fanboys, but its still is popular since ultimately reddit does'nt  reflect popularity   and are just another factor of an echo chamber.
I could be wrong (I haven't kept up on the business end of esports for a few years) but I believe the big difference is that LoL players have fairly high salaries with lower prize pools vs many other esports where the prize pools represents the bulk of players income.
woman's breast milk and bullying her to death. Or was that Blizzard?
A little depressed that I know this but Jack criticized Mr Beast for his style of content ruining YouTube, which didn’t mention YouTube’s own push towards corporatization and over-romanticized the platform’s past.
They're multimillionaires that made money through views. There is no drama except what they've agreed to manufacture.
Isnt jack mellow
He has so many iconic moments and lines from casters, he won a 1v1 10 years ago where the caster went “FAKER WHAT WAS THAT” and nowadays if anyone makes a cool play or you wanna be sarcastic and make fun of someone you just go “NAME WHAT WAS THAT”
The NBAs obsession with superstars is one of the reasons why it sucks. It’s moved from a competition  into a bad reality show where the majority of the fan base lacks even a passing knowledge of the basics of how the sport is played.
Did they though? They didn't really face many strong teams on their way to the finals. Gen G was taken out in a narrow victory from BLG. Don't really need to say anything of NRG. BLG and WBG were competing for who could throw their game the hardest. People were talking about a blue side meta, and that's the only way that JDG took a game off of T1. But T1 smashed WBG three consecutive games with red side. I think WBG were incredibly lucky to make it into the finals, both in which opponents they met and the form their opponents were in during their matches. 
So happy to get an Ahri skin hopefully. Or fuck it another Azir skin.
It's worse than ever from my experience. Sure you can't be overtly racist in chat or spam ping, but every time I've tried to say a single line in-game I've had some variation of "stop talking" or "shut up".
Ya, LoL isn't toxic in the sense of verbal abuse, it's toxic in that everyone thinks they're the main character and if you fuck up once or make a request to do something different than what they're already doing they get pissed and grief or soft-int (still griefing) for the rest of the game.
It’s definitely a “mute everyone and queue with friends” game, otherwise your mental and game agency will get stripped away by toxic people.
[deleted]
That is not why they got rid of tribunal. They got rid of tribunal cause it sucked and people were clicking random shit to get rewards. 
Every year more players
It would be kinda dumb for Vegas to not be a night race, don't you think?
You want to put Vegas traffic at a stand still during the busy day? Nah that is why they kept it so late at night
T1 decided that actually, their top laner can play whatever he wants, it doesn't matter what Faker plays, and Guma/Keria can stomp with any champions. 
Meta was mainly engage supports but T1 sort of created their own meta that everyone followed with ranged supports
There were 3-4 really disgusting champs that seemed completely unbeatable, Xayah was tier 0 and was an auto win for her team, midlane played 2 champions, sup was engage only, toplane was 3 champions
With Chinese viewers, T1 vs JDG had 30 million watchers.
i think vietnam is the 7th most populated server according to op.gg ranked leaderboard 
Yeah, the metrics for views on LCS see trending downwards, and are lower than they were a decade ago, despite the sport growing massively since then. Nobody's interested in watching a league with teams that can't compete on the international stage.
This year was NAs best showing in years.  Not really saying much, but still.
They did better than EU this year, though.
NRG performed way above expectations and also humiliated EU with a team made up of homegrown talent instead of washed up overpaid imports. Not all doom and gloom for NA.
Did you watch this year's world's?
Sounds like every Esports. Wonder how long till Valorant will follow the same cycle
NA had to be alive at some point in order to be dying. 
[deleted]
NA is meme tier on the world stage. We are to them what Brazil is to us. Hell I've even seen BR teams perform on par with NA teams on the world's stage.
I think N.A. is getting better in the competitive scene too. Not only that multiple N.A. players heading to Korea and quickly get challenger.
I struggle to get back into Dota and I still religiously watch TI every year. Both of these games are absolutely terrible at easing returning players back in
It absolutely pulls in more watchers than players these days. At least on the western side. Especially when it has big name pulls like Faker (or even that kpop group NewJeans which im sure some people tuned in just for)
Not sure about "way" worse. The format changes brought record viewership to every step of the tournament, not just T1 games or the finals.
It's not. Riot reported this year that NA has a growing playerbase, but less people are playing ranked. 
strong in NA, quickly dying in EU
I also just don’t think the game gets enough credit. It’s extremely deep and tactical while still being flashy and skill expressive. 
MOBAs are probably the easiest e-sport to watch, which helps. You can see what multiple players are doing at once
World class production, a podcast, two theme songs, the opening show, the stage design, fresh champ pool and balance, storyline team, etc...
I didn't realize how good I was having it with league when it comes to balance, until I started playing overwatch.
The lore is insane
League is about as big as cs in Europe.
Its bigger.
"Proper esports" develop naturally as a result of passion and commitment from the community, not from any official endorsement or oversight.
yeah, but to get into finals, t1 had to beat fuckin JDG and LNG, while WBG beat only western teams and BLG. meanwhile KT had by far the hardest lineups throughout the whole tournament. it’s a byproduct of an overall better format, but we’re not exactly used to one fluke getting you to finals
One upset from WBG lead to a 3-0 lame final. Honestly based on Summer Playoffs, if GENG didn't lose to BLG in a 5 game series they might have just beat T1 anyways.
The main problem is still that there's no double elimination during the playoff stage. Having only one chance means that a team like JDG who didn't lose a single BO5 up until the semifinals this whole year won't be in the finals because their jungler slumped on the day, while Weibo, who had much worse results throughout the year, got there with their only BO5 win that was an upset this year was against BLG on the other side of the bracket. Imagine if JDG would have had a second chance at the Golden Road, facing the T1 that peaked at its highest in years at the right time.
Personally, my ideal esport is Rocket League.
China also inflates their numbers by a large margin.
i doubt it but thx lmao
That is an excellent link, thank you so much.
They don't have a response, literally every esport are skilled based.
[removed]
Apex legends where it's controller vs m+kb
apex for example
Button-mashing chess players
Because it's by far the most popular competetive game in the world and by virtue of that that also has the steepest competition. There are obviously other dominant players in more niche games but that's like comparing the largest fish in the tank vs the largest fish in the ocean
I can't think of any other esports player who's won a world championship 10 years after their first one
Yatoro hasn't achieved that longevity yet
Flash is a god and people don't know it
the delusion about riot games or league from other subreddits other than the actual league subreddit its insane
As opposed to?
It is true, the numbers that are shown are arbitrary.  But Riot will always release the official numbers a bit later
it's easier for people to quickly form an all-encompassing judgment and move on.  some of it is because many of those stories have truth.  how do you think those fringe theories stay relevant though?
Because that is partially true.
Back in my day he had already secured his legacy 😂
I don't even play or watch League and I know that name, all I know is the dude's crazy.
He’s never played me.
Isn't he still in like literally every single Worlds trailer that they make each year? I vaguely recall the last one even having the song break down with the word "god" with Faker doing a fucking superhero landing on beat.
I didn't even care about Worlds until I saw the Faker Ruler fight with all the history behind it.
He's the Wayne Gretsky of esports. Not just indisputably the goat of his sport, but arguably the goat of all team esports.
Pretty sure his third did that too hey
To put Faker into some perspective he currently has the same win-loss numbers in worlds finals as Wayne Gretzky has in Stanley Cup finals, both are 4 wins out of 6 appearances.
Can he get a full exemption from military service? Even during the heights of Starcraft BW everyone had to eventualy do the military service. But they made a Military Branch BW team so they did not have to take the full time, but that team was pretty much always expected to finish last in the league.
Respect APA?
Show some respect to Nisqy.
[removed]
Meh I’m not saying he is bad or carried but he is far from the best mid laner now. I find Diagos career in Street fighter way more impressive man’s been at the top level since 1998
Korean wayne Gretzky
Age never really mattered, it's moreso just moving on with your life and not being able to commit 10-12 hours a day, 6 days a week working. 
Man this brings back so many memories, I still remember when this nick name was new in S3 world, his first international tournament and he already cement himself as a Goat, and he still is 10 years later, his consistency is absolutely bonkers.
His monthly spend is about 200$, he refuse to trash talk his opponents, refuses to give thumbs down 👎 when asked by photographer, the most Humble GOAT of all time, i am goona cry when he retires😭😭.
I was just in South Korea and he's all over advertisements for Samsung and other Korean companies. Mans's got the bag ten times over.
He owns 9 story building in Seoul, is part owner of T1, had $20mil/year offers from China (or even blank cheque), yet he is still the same humble person as 10 years ago.
He also got his family jobs at T1 too.
He ownes some stock not exactly a equal level. He does however own a highrise building.
Classic TheShy experience. His BLG series was probably one of his best international showing only to follow up with whatever this mess is
What does "micro" mean in league? As far as I understand the game does not have traditional micro, right?
We got to PC gaming later, I think that's what it is. On consoles, you're constantly upgrading your shooters or sports game every year.
They are a notorious doomposter on the league subreddit, so probably the league subreddit. And that place really fucking does hate the game nowadays, very rare to see anything positive on the frontpage at all. In fact the sub played a part in harassing the lead balance dev so much and harshly they decided to leave social media so that's pretty cool.
That makes sense if that's the case.
I don't know how strongly he criticized it, but I could imagine it being more frustration with the landscape as a whole and less that the person who started it makes videos as they do. It's not like MrBeast expected such a result, but also it's easy to go "If you just hadn't bothered we wouldn't be in this mess!", though there's obviously no putting the genie back in the bottle on that one. Less anger at the individual and more frustration at the helplessness of the situation, so wanting something to blame tends to follow.
Damn, I remember that, thought it was ages ago.
Youtubes past should be MORE over-romanitcized. The moment people started to get paid for uploading movies, hoppies and passion turned into content and side hussles.
MB's videos really are crazy ADD feeling. They're like super intense, high concept reality TV or something.
Memory might be fuzzy but I believe Jack commented about this in one of his videos. You're right that he criticized Mr. Beast's STYLE. But, almost everyone thought he criticized him directly. The comment was directed at people who copies Mr. Beast and creates videos for views and clout instead of being genuine.
Sometimes I figure it's more of an informal agreement. Like you say something, the other guy realizes he can act offended for views, and you stoke the flames for more views. Basically neither ever have an actual conversation about it but go to sleep thinking "honestly I don't give a fuck about this but hey it's cash"
If only more people realized this about 99% of online drama.

"Palafoxs shockwave will find them all!x
There’s a clip too, can’t remember who, of a caster just yelling “FAKER!” that lives Rent free in my head. I’m sure somebody knows the one and can share it.
Sadly a few years ago when Faker wasn't at the top of his game, he made a really terrible play on Qiyana, who was very meta during the tournament, and one of the casters said, "Faker, what was that?". It broke my heart and I was so worried he was done for.
Crisp is a superb renata player...and then they gave it to the opponent
I'll admit that I haven't seen all of the matches, but from what I did see they were real scrappy and at points almost lost until their opponents blundered hard. either in draft or in game
The last Azir skin wasn't even his. Kind of think he should get an Unkillable Demon King Azir for the fans and an Ahri skin for himself. As the most legendary player ever he deserves it. Or maybe they'd reserve the Azir skin for when he retires.
Faker's gonna buy two more towers just with the T1 Ahri skin money.
They get a share of the skins they sell, ahri is ten times more popular than azir, money wise picking ahri for the skin is making millions more dollars
The last Azir skin wasn't even his. Kind of think he should get an Unkillable Demon King Azir for the fans and an Ahri skin for himself. As the most legendary player ever he deserves it. Or maybe they'd reserve the Azir skin for when he retires.
Because there's nothing you can do outside of changing the game itself, it's designed (not saying this on purpose) to be toxic. 4 randoms on your team, 1 person loses lane hard and you already know what can come next. 
every time I've tried to say a single line in-game I've had some variation of "stop talking" or "shut up".
I think it's the fact a lot of kids these days have never actually been able to co op play with their friends/siblings. Like when I first played DOTA the Warcraft 3 mod I was actually Ina cyber cafe with the people there and you wouldn't be as much of a toxic troll to real people in real life. Before that I would pay like Mario kart and Golden eye with actual friends and we were socializing and of course chiding each other like you soon of a bitch you better not pick Eddie from Tekken 2 again. 
It's a bottom of the barrel online "community", amongst all the gaming communities that are already shit tier as is. There is, as a matter of cold hard facts, not a single mainstream game where you can find any dumber fucks. It's the equivalent of  default subs on reddit
Yeah but the sun sets at like 5pm now, you have a lot of options for when to start a night race.
That and the lights of the strip
I think Keria is legitimately the best player on the planet right now and has been for a couple years now, he's so absurdly good at whatever he picks
And in this series they actually kind of brought Xayah and Rakan back after they made other teams switch off it.
it's like the "meta" in pro play is not really the meta.
You can't know Chinese viewers. It's not the same as normal viewer numbers. That's why no one uses their numbers for stats like these posted by OP.
Remember reading before of Vietnam having a bigger server population than NA.  Might be wrong though.
That isn’t true. The French league is massive despite its teams unable to compete in LEC or Worlds. I think it’s more about how can people connect with the teams and what stories are being told throughout the season.
One of my pet theories is that the reason the eSports bubble kinda "popped" is just because NA is concurrently bad at LoL, CS, and Dota, and all the people throwing crazy money at it really needed this to not happen as we Americans spend a lot of money lol
Better ask what NRG was doing right, oh wait Steve doing another attempt at a Korean roster instead of developing a project that could shine in 2-3 years.
It's true for (association) football, it's true for LCS, it's true for CS. Sad thing since the US brings big money to everything it watches (which is something that e-sports need), but it is what it is.
despite the sport growing massively since then
I doubt he watched Worlds and he's just talking out of his ass. If anything, EU  under-performed this year.
EU isn't a particularly high bar, especially this season.
>homegrown talent
s8 was significant, its their only semis
These numbers don’t include China.
Same here, I know roughly what is going on enough to enjoy watching the streams and get into it a bit.  I suck at the game so badly that I no longer play it though :P
And last years finals was also the most watched esports event ever when it was in NA, an inopportune time for China and Korea to watch it.
Hopefully they bring back unique events and game modes.
I'd disagree and say an RTS like SC2 is the best to watch. If you don't know anything about league, it's basically impossible to follow or understand why players are doing what they're doing. And even if you know, the team fights are just a couple seconds of spell effects and then you look at who lost more people. SC2 games take half the time and are strictly 1v1, so the action is easier to follow. Even if you know nothing about the game, it's easy to understand when big armies smash into each other.
Agreed but I give Riot credit for growing their game while DOTA and HOTS seems to have fallen off a cliff popularity wise.
I'd say fighting games are easier because you can enjoy watching with relatively little game knowledge. MOBAs are hard to follow if you aren't familiar with the game. I agree that the camera perspective in MOBAs is really nice, especially compared to the spectator options for some fast-paced shooters.
or Imo any other competitive game, its actually crazy how blessed league is with riot
Yep, haven't even heard about CS in a while on my country but I know full well some countries never left that hype train.
Imo the format is almost perfect but needs two things;
WBG defeated BLG who defeated GenG
T1 also stomped LNG and JDG. They just managed to scale up and have the best read of the meta.
Imagine if JDG would have had a second chance at the Golden Road, facing the T1 that peaked at its highest in years at the right time.
ur right, the more punishing swiss format is meant to weed out weaker teams sooner, but it proved to be a little too punishing. riot might need to pad out the swiss stage a bit to give teams more breathing room
Even if they do it still many more
Source: An angel revealed it to me in a dream
boy, the downvotes when it's a known fact that Chinese viewer metrics are literally not actual viewing numbers but around engagement and such, not views and thus are always inflated. 
The numbers that come directly from Riot are the only ones reliable for China, since Chinese streaming services don't have a public spectator count. All the other regions have live viewer counts that ar accurate, as far as everyone knows.
Not downplaying the players but League or CS require much more strategy and thinking than fortnite or apex.
Skill-based, sure, but some definitely have more luck involved than others. A game like LoL or CS has very, very low luck factor. Meanwhile something like a card game obviously is skill-based to some extent, but also has a large luck factor of drawing the correct cards at the correct time.

hahaha you gave me a good laugh
I’d say most Melee players keep that longevity going for 20 years, Leffen has won Evo for two games
Mango is both the youngest and oldest player to win a melee major.
Tokido won Street Fighter 2 at Evo 2007, won Street Fighter 4 at CEO 2011, then won Street Fighter 5 at Evo 2017. They got 2nd at SF6's first Evo, and that's just mentioning his Street Fighter accomplishments. He's also won tournaments for Persona, Soul Calibur etc.
has to be dota players trolling or very young people. im not even playing league anymore but there was a time everyone i knew on pc played league.
Ah, most definitely flawless games for sure, ignore the shitshow that is CS2 right now, and certainly everyone would call DOTA the most exciting game on the planet, yeah? You can hate League, but it is the most popular game in the world, dwarfing DOTA and CS, surely it can't be that bad of a game to remain the king of gaming for nearly a decade now?
Split faker's career into two and he just takes the #1 and #2 goat spots, that's how insane it is.
That's what he means. Faker was already the best back in the day, but while in other sports/esports other players might rise and become
the best, Faker has NEVER faltered and lost that title. He's STILL the best and there's never been a question and at this point, winning another worlds, it's cemented he's the best and until he retires there likely won't be someone better.
Even before Tetizeeaz's day, Faker already secured his legacy.
He's been the best for longer than quite a few other pros' entire careers lasted.
Of course not, he’s not Silver.
Nah that would be Flash.
In short, Yes Faker's situation seems like he's fully exempted. expanding on that, the Asian Games are an Olympics-Sanctioned event which means a gold there is as good as a gold in Paris next year. So if any S-Korean athletes win a Gold, they're more or less guaranteed to get an exemption form Service
No joke he had one of the better showings against Faker of the whole tournament.
Nah, you can't be overlooking Palafaker
[removed]
So who is better right now?
I don’t think there was literally any basis in gaming for players with long careers is the main thing I’m saying. Some that went from BW to WoL but no one has been literally top of the global charts for a game for 10+ years. It IS both a testament to the game staying relevant, but more to the player IMO
Funny thing is he never gonna spend all that money, mf is living in 200$ budget
It's so insane how T1 can take a single mistake like that and blow the whole game open on the back of it that quickly. The shy dying there with that stacked wave let Zeus put his foot on the gas and never took it off.
Micro is what you do in a fight. Macro is how you affect the map through vision, map pressure, etc.
It does?
Majority of na gaming is still consoles.
Man, don't use subreddits as an indication of what "most people" think about something.
I could imagine it being more frustration with the landscape as a whole
The alternative is YouTube makes shit loads of money for Google and creators get nothing. I get what you're saying, but this was always going to happen to the platform.
Regardless of what his content is like, Mr Beast collaborates with some vile content creators who don't deserve such legitimacy. Seeing that sent me from apathetic of his existence to disliking him.
I don't watch MB, but his content has "splashed" over onto other channels like William Osman being hired to do effects for MB Squid Game. William seemed be enjoy working with/for MB, but boy did it feel very sweat shoppy.
That's just the difference between an explicit and an implicit conspiracy.

a certified -__- moment
you only get so many bans
It's either giving Faker Azir or Orianna or giving Renata to Keria.
A skin doesn’t cut it. They should give him a champ when he retires.
Faker wanted an Ahri skin since Season 3, and Faker being the person he is, he definitely doesn't care about the money he'll make off the skin.
If someone on my team loses their lane I take the rest of the game as an opportunity for low-stakes practice.
under $5
The silver lining is I've learned how to be told to be quiet in so many different languages
It's Vegas - people don't even wake up until 4pm
Keria on Bard was my favorite thing to watch this tournament. He pulled off some insane plays and carried some games with perfect ults and stuns.
To be fair, Guma and Keria could have played just about anything, the gap between WBG and T1 was that vast.
Xayah has like a 90% pick ban rate this tournament. They didn’t bring her back, they just simply out drafted their opponents.
It's mostly the Rakan, Xayah lost priority in semis but Rakan is still S tier. It was perma banned in most games before that
That stat was quoted at the world’s final media day by riot themselves. Not skimmed from weibo and bilibili impressions.EDIT: I was wrong, it was 33 million https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/s/kguCGJhUfh
That's not true. Official Chinese viewership numbers are legit. It's only when someone who doesn't understand Chinese misinterprets the popularity index from Chinese streaming sites and posts numbers are wrong. It's an issue with translators, not the Chinese.
Brazil too.
One of my pet theories is that the reason the eSports bubble kinda "popped" is just because NA is concurrently bad at LoL, CS, and Dota
Gonna be interesting to see what happens with TL I guess. The trend of LCS outspending for Korean talent has been going on for a while now, and it's not really working.
Need to spice it up. Bring in some bikini babes and monster trucks.
I legit can't believe TL went with a full KR speaking roster. The things they will do to try to "buy" wins, instead of developing domestic talent.
They literally fielded 3 rookies this year, what are you yapping about. NRG did well with already established players who were given a second chance, Dhokla, Contractz and Ignar were being called paycheck stealers until last split. TL tried to field rookies even though they were comfortably their worst players.
The situation for football will be interesting to watch. Having Messi in the MLS might bring in new young fans that could help build the future of football in the US. I don't really see the same thing happening in League, outside of if Faker learns English and goes to the LCS.
According to esportsCharts, this Worlds hit a new record for English language viewership as well, which is doubly impressive since last year's Worlds was in NA. Anecdotally, I can say a number of my friends who don't really watch League woke up for it because it was such an event (even my brother who barely plays games at all texted me about it). Riot is just facing the issue of trickling that interest down into the individual leagues.
The fact that the finale today had peak viewership the highest of any esports event sure seems to indicate that the sport has grown quite a bit.
It is growing in CN and SA and stable if not growing in EU and KR.
Yet, he is +251 at this time.
NRG beat G2 3-0. All of NA clowned on MAD. NA was better than EU this year, no doubt about it. I guess EU has a better 4th place team.
considering the other teams in lcs thats rly not that bad
FBI has spent more years playing in NA than he ever played in OCE at this point, and OCE players are regarded as native players for LCS rosters anyway.
oh wow, my bad. That's crazy considering the timezone then, lol
They are! There's a game modes team actively working on stuff! They deployed nexus blitz again and in a few weeks we are getting a 2v2v2v2 arena from this summer but with a ton of balance changes and like 60+ new traits and map/event changes and apparently they are working on other stuff too. Seems league is finally being ran in a way that players wanted for a while now. I assume we will also get something huge next year for 15th anniversary
That’s probably valid. I’ll be honest StarCraft barely registers to me as it’s such an old game. When is the next major?
I'm not convinced by the week-long gap between semis and finals, either. Teams need time to rest and prep, but it seems excessive. For better or worse, it seems like they prioritize weekend play times.
Absolutely no loser's bracket for knockouts. If we had a loser's bracket in 2022 would DRX' cinderella story have happened? Upsets are interesting and a loser's bracket takes that away. Knockouts should be do or die, no second chances.
and GenG beat T1 who defeated WBG, i'm completely fine with WBG beating BLG and advancing but usually it takes more than one fluke to get into finals
I wouldn't call the JDG series a stomp, even ignoring a 3-1 scoreline two of JDG loses were close and even their win wasn't one sided. The real final atleast, though seeing Kanavi kinda run it down in game 4 felt like man was still playing for Team Korea
They didn't stomp jdg lmao
That has a relatively easy fix, make the final event a BO7 and start the winner's bracket finals winner with one win, in this case T1. That way they get an advantage for going unbeaten during the playoff stage while also giving the rival team a challenge they must overcome to truly become the triumphant team without the need for a bracket reset and taking another day in the schedule.
its well known it is lmao
Fuck, I new it was popular but I didn't realize it was that popular.
NA and Korea have one server, EU has two, China has twenty-nine. 
Idk if I agree it requires less thinking/strategy but… Fortnite and Apex barely register as competitive games. Battle royale isn’t a good competitive format.  It’s too asymmetrical and RNG focused.  Obviously there’s skill expression but the variables don’t really create a strong format for a sport.
Please read our rules, specifically Rule #2 regarding personal attacks and inflammatory language. We ask that you remember to remain civil, as future violations will result in a ban.
LoL is way more competitive than Smash though, there's significantly more investment in the LoL scene and the playerbase is literally multiple orders of magnitude larger than competitive Smash. Faker's legacy is way more impressive given the context
But there's a lot more competition and interest in league, there are tons of people who want to be in Faker's spot.
but to be fair, there's a lot more people competing to be in Faker's spot
I remember before he was really known and not even a pro player when his Leblanc gameplay videos were being posted and for the time was absolutely unreal gameplay. That was I think more than 11 years ago.
The Wayne Gretzky of e-sports
That’s just how GOATs are, Tom Brady, Lebron, Kobe Bryant, MJ, all had two HoF careers
Dude's legit superhuman at this point.
He looked better than ever this year. When he was out with an injured wrist, his team looked utterly amateurish, in danger of missing the tournament altogether. And then this run to the finals where T1 just plain danced around their opponents. 11-1 against the LPL. JDG the super team managed to win one game. LNG, the number two, got only one objective all series - a single herald that didn’t even manage to tackle a tower.
What is this revisionist history? This is the best he's looked in a WHILE. Definitely the 🐐 but he wasn't the best mid in the LCK let alone the world for his whole career. Plenty of dips in form. Which is fine, he's outlasting everyone else and his peaks were dominant af.
Laughs in Flash
I love the ozymandias reference but the irony of using it in this thread given the meaning of the poem is pretty funny.
True. He's at least gold since we know he lost to a gold brand.
Didn't Flash fall off in SC2? Faker for 10 years has been either the best or near the top. To hold that level of consistency and be the glue that makes the team work in the first place is pretty insane.
And then he got fucken creamed by Palafox lmao.  The NA boys did pretty good this worlds
It’s a different game. How can you compare? Faker made top5 players at this tournament diago places top 5 all the time and he started playing competitive the year Faker was born
Fighting game players have long careers. Guys like Tokido, Daigo, and Fuudo are in their late 30s/early 40s and still strong. Fuudo's 38 and probably the strongest SF6 player in Japan atm.
It's interesting because a lot of Asian league players come from lower class backgrounds and humble upbringings.  It's pretty much the opposite for the Westerm players
An RTS player will often associate micro with control of multiple units since that's usually how the skill is expressed in those games. You're correct that micro actually refers to the specific commands you give to units you control, even if you control just one.
Micro in RTS ga,es refer to controlling specific individual units in your larger army e.g. blinking(think flash from lol) individual stalkers back before they die in SC2 allowing full health stalkers to be on the front line
Micro in my experience is managing / controlling multiple units at once, which as far as I know, league is extremely light on, Annie's bear for example.
Oh trust me, I agree with you. Just saying that's probably where he gets it. Most terminally online people think the online bubble is the only place that exists and matters, you can see it when people call a game dead when it's viewership drops on twitch even when it still has a sizable playerbase.
Yeah back in the day if the series went 1-1, the final game was blind pick for some reason, huge meme.
at minimun an item
i think i remember that faker picked ahri back then specifically because of that exact reason lol. i could be completely wrong though.
Well yeah but some people are annoyed that their "time" is wasted so to speak and that usually where it stems from, usage of time that didn't equal a win. You do this over and over with 4 randoms every game then :)
Oh, so you're on EU(probably W)?
Sadly, it's only second fastest. Fastest is still IG vs Fnatic.
Zeus casually flame horizoning TheShy in G1.
26 seconds longer than FNC vs iG S8
IIRC it was the fastest finals ever
instead of developing domestic talent.
What are you talking about lol, TL literally promoted 2 rookies from academy, then another one from challengers when one of the 2 first rookies was not doing so hot. They ended up with a two-NA native roster, which is more than you can say about C9 who fielded zero rookies and just one native player. TL literally did what fans where clamoring about, they promoted rookies while also being one of the only teams to keep their academy roster. "Buy wins" my ass.
TL did develop talent - Haeri and Yeon were promoted from academy after being dominant in 2021 and 2022
The Apple TV deal will help MLS as well, imo. A lot of people want to watch some form of sport without having to juggle services just to watch their team, and Apple TV condenses things down to just one service. It's why I started watching MLS this year, at least. 
Riot is just facing the issue of trickling that interest down into the individual leagues.
For league of legends specifically 
Viewers doesn't equal players. A record super bowl or world cup viewership doesn't necessarily mean you have more football players that year.
NRG beat G2 3-0.
FBI spending more time in NA doesn't make him homegrown, same for Ignar.
I think the weeklong gap is fine, it gives Riot time to build hype and gives the teams time to fully prepare, not to mention viewers don't have to worry about life getting in the way during the week, it works best for everyone.
Did you even watch the JDG game?
Tencent invested in Riot before League even came out, I don't think that anyone expected the game to become so popular.
Those games have big esports scenes which is what the guy above said and I replied to. The prize money in fortnite and even apex is comparable to many cs tournaments.
Faker has also had slips in form, that if he wasn't Faker and brought the name recognition that being Faker brings, would have resulted in him being dropped.
There isn't. Fighting games have some of the largest entry numbers for games. In something like League, you need an entire team before you can even compete, so the number of people actually entering events (competing to be in Faker's spot) is going to be much lower.
Now the meta has changed, nowadays he mostly mind control his teammates into playing like absolute best.
he only hopped into a ranked queue cause his norms were taking too long and so he started getting noticed.
I remember seeing heaps of Asian Lee Sin gameplay clips start popping up and that's the moment I quit league forever and started just watching worlds and Korean/Chinese regionals. The way they can make Lee Sin work makes my brain itch.
HoF and goat is really far apart though. Also LeBron has like 3 HoF careers at this point, which is insane.
Yeah his time away showed Faker is the most valuable player in the world.  It's insane how the rest of them forgot how to play when Faker isn't there
he's pretty constant at least top 5 world some years he is top 3, some top 5 but never gets below that, and in this year I think it was pretty clear he was the best
the ceaseless sands of time come for us all in the end
You compared games, not me. I'm asking who's the better midlaner right now?
Fighting games are mostly a mental game, at least at the top levels.  They are incredibly skilled players, but reflexes matter less and so aging is less detrimental.
In League it's also controlling state of your lane, e.g. state of the minion wave, spacing from lane opponent, sneaking auto-attacks here and there with specific intent and timing - basically "making sure" you can win lane if you don't make any big mistake.
Well not only RTS, dota has micro too as some heroes require you to control multiple units at once. Not sure what other games have it, I've seen some single player games with it surprisingly though.
Yes, so micro in LoL is mechanically controlling your specific champion. Wheres macro is reading the overall state of the map - where everyone is positioned that you see, where you should be, what you should be doing, where the missing enemy champions might be, where you should be in 30 seconds, in 2mins, in 5mins, etc.
Yea That's RTS micro.  It's not mutually exclusive to RTS
well that's a dogshit comparison because league is not an RTS LMAO
single unit micro was still called micro even in the old days. think 1v1 probe vs. scv. or AoE's villager quick walls
My bad, I didn't check your user and thought you were the original guy I was responding to. Your first sentence also makes way more sense to me now lol
No, you're right. Back then, since his 1v1 Zed mirror match outplay vs Ryu was so famous, Riot wanted him to have a Zed skin instead since also Ahri was about to get a skin anyway (Popstar). There was also a rule that in order to get a world skin for a champ, you have to play that champ during that tourney., which is why he got Syndra and Ryze for the other wins.
Why is time in quotes? It is literally time.
EUW indeed!
Aw, that would have been a nice stat
EG winning TI5 but then proceeding to be mid and 3rd place for the rest of the 2010s and its consequences were a disaster for NA dota
Our strength in esports isn't with mobas but we do pretty well in fighting games! I can actually have national pride for once in esports, we have a lot of insane players in the FGC here.
U.S league reminds me of women’s chess. There’s just less money to be earned there when compared to other things, it requires a lot of time to properly learn (and in leagues case, learn the changes), and chances are if you’re not a natural prodigy, you won’t be playing against people good enough to really challenge and raise your level and even if you get to a high lvl there isn’t enough variety of players like in korea.You’ll plateau a lot sooner than people who are able to play in inherently challenging leagues
This take brought to you but the fine folks at r/leagueoglegends
Eh, CS, DOTA, R6S and a few other games are all keeping their heads above water or doing well.
OWL also was destined to fail from the start, the whole premise was stupid, the game barely watchable as someone who doesn't play it much (which is the audience they hoped to attract, which is mind boggling), and having a league where people invested tens of millions of dollars and then just not update the game for basically 2 years is also one of the decisions of all time.
Not a lot of new good multi games are coming out that are also esports ready and viable.
dpc dead and true sight also dead (thanks valve)
Tbf Cod was/is kinda toxic. I remember that(when I looked into it) actually shouting and being mad at the opposing team(like a COD lobby) was okay and actively encouraged. Just cringe to see dudes get up from their chairs and shout obscenities at the other team on stage.
Oops, it was 2-0. 
Yes, and if you think t1 stomped jdg I think you didn't watch the series
This is definitely not true lol 
I mean that there's a ton more money in league, so more people would be willing to commit to it as a career choice.
In league you’re being scouted while in high school and recruited to gaming houses before you hit 18. Faker won his first championship at age 17.
this is complete delusion tho
earlier this year when he had wrist injuries (maybe he was sick, I forget the actual issue), he had to stop playing for a few weeks and his team went 1-7 almost not qualifying for Worlds entirely.
Because he’s the absolute shot caller and play maker. You ever see him check his lanes?  It looks like his screen is glitching out.
in league the contrast in much more simple : 
Not really when you consider other MOBAs like DOTA have micro heroes who control multiple units as a time.
DPC dying isn't a bad thing.
In 2021 there were definitely calls to bench him when T1 were in their skid.
Jeez, must be demoralizing to realize that youre practically being carried by one person on your team and are pretty much lost without him.
His teammates are arguably better at the game on a mechanical level when it comes to overall gameplay. He just brings a lot of experience, shotcalling, leadership, and can make his teammates shine bright.
